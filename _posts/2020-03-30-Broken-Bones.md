Here I offer some unsolicited advice on how to heal your broken bones.
If you are lucky, you will not need surgery, to put your bones in proper places. But if you manage to exceed 4000 N of force and shatter them, they might need to be realigned with some light metallic structure. After that, you will need to wear a cast. This is to make sure that the bones will not further break into pieces and that they'd be allowed to consolidate.

If you broke your leg, you should not put weight on it. You will lose muscle mass. You will need some friends. I needed my friends. In the beginning, someone will give you a bath, will prepare all your food, get your water and wash your clothes. You may feel guilty so you never ever forget to thank them. Never forget their kindness.

Gradually, you will be able to crawl. Fix your things. Grab your own water. Little by little, you will be able to lessen the load for them. You can learn some techniques on self-sufficiency. In taking a bath, you could grab a towel, sit next to the wash basin and clean yourself. When grabbing food, you could try carrying small bag and a sealed container while on your crutches. If you could afford it, buy a knee scooter. It can get you many places. You could begin to get your own groceries and wash your own clothes. If you are in a country that values people with disabilities, you will be super thankful for the ramps in trams, buses and buildings. You'll see how "social care" and "self-care" are equally important.

I was a month and half into my fracture when I first did my own laundry. I took a photo of it. Because it felt nice. I miss my friend who had done it for me but I was also proud to tell him "Hey, I've done this on my own now!".

The healing of the broken bone is not to be rushed. It has its own time. But to be on schedule, you will need to take extra care of yourself. Eat right. Get vitamin D. Drink Milk, if you can. I've also gotten an effervescent calcium supplement that's super tasty. That makes me drink lots of water too!

On the third month, the doctor said that I could put some weight on my bones. He said, 10 kg per week. Even if the xray shows a lot of "radioluscent" parts, i.e. a lack of consolidation, he said it was normal. So slowly, I practiced walking. I also used the fitness bands that I bought. From 10 lbs, to 20 lbs, to 40 lbs for each leg and some ankle dorsiflexion. I was able to progress. And now, I mix the bands and can do 10+20+40 = 70 lbs. Before I broke my leg, I could do machine leg presses for 295 lbs. So I guess I'm getting closer.

Again, do not rush. But also do not take it too slow. On some days, it will hurt and it's ok to not make progress. It's ok to just hurt. It's ok to just rest. But always, always move forward. Always try to walk on.

Here I always try to look at the mountains. Almost all the time they are always within view. And I use that as an inspiration to gain my full range of motion.

To be able to walk on my own is such a pleasure. While I can say I "worked very hard" to be self-sufficient, I am mostly indebted to people who were my metaphorical crutches. There is no such thing as being 100 percent self-sufficiency. You will always need good people around you. I felt that one way to get back to them was to try to not delay "walking on" when I felt that I could. Even if it scared me. But maybe I had the courage, because I knew they were there if I had to come back. Sometimes, I felt like coming back but I walked on. There was really no point in being forever having a "butler" or having people always do things for you when you can. And I am happy that I did fly and face the inevitable. Now, I've something to bring home. It feels good to also have something to offer, give back or pass forward. And it is probably good news for them that I could finally walk.

But damn, still can't go to the mountains because the pandemic got in the way. These times are strange. So sometimes our hearts will be as fragile as a freshly broken bone. In that case, reach out. People are normally kind. You don't have to lean on just on yourself or just one person. And there's no shame in needing help even for some time. 

<!-- Let's face it. Healing your bone is a lot like healing your heart. Although they break very differently. And I believe walking on is a great act of love, for yourself and the person or the people you love or once loved. -->

<!-- P.S. -->

<!-- Do not fret about the scary thought of walking alone. On different occasions, you will be lucky to have beautiful random walks with people with the best kinds of conversations. The types that stays with you - in a good way. I hope when this blows over you'd find the kinds of walks you were hoping for. Or maybe just not expect anything and let life surprise you. Solitary walks are still beautiful though.  -->
