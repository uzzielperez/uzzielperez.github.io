So only a few people has the direct link to this blog. :) I do not like to share it widely because I know a lot of my thoughts are not well-formed and they often evolve.
It also doesn't have any analytics built in and I like it that way so there is no "pressure to perform". It's pure sharing.


I enjoyed reading this, https://kk.org/thetechnium/99-additional-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/ and picked out some favorites. :)

• That thing that made you weird as a kid could make you great as an adult — if you don’t lose it.

• If you have any doubt at all about being able to carry a load in one trip, do yourself a huge favor and make two trips.

• What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals. At your funeral people will not recall what you did; they will only remember how you made them feel.

• Recipe for success: under-promise and over-deliver.

• Jesus, Superman, and Mother Teresa never made art. Only imperfect beings can make art because art begins in what is broken.

• Being wise means having more questions than answers.

• Sustained outrage makes you stupid.

• Be strict with yourself and forgiving of others. The reverse is hell for everyone.

• Your best response to an insult is “You’re probably right.” Often they are.

• The worst evils in history have always been committed by those who truly believed they were combating evil. Beware of combating evil.

• Be the change you wish to see.

• Contemplating the weaknesses of others is easy; contemplating the weaknesses in yourself is hard, but it pays a much higher reward.

• To quiet a crowd or a drunk, just whisper.

• I have never met a person I admired who did not read more books than I did.

• A problem that can be solved with money is not really a problem.

• History teaches us that in 100 years from now some of the assumptions you believed will turn out to be wrong. A good question to ask yourself today is “What might I be wrong about?”

• Advice like these are not laws. They are like hats. If one doesn’t fit, try another.

One of those "simple" things I enjoy.
