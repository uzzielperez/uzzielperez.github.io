When I was still a troubled college-student, I used to take comfort in watching and rewatching a Japanese Drama Comedy called "Zettai Kareshi". In English "Zettai Kareshi" means "Absolute Boyfriend". The protagonist, Riiko was invited to join an experiment, after she had gotten her heart broken by a guy who 'played' with her feelings, supposedly. Feeling like there was nothing to lose, she joined the experiment. She was asked to select from a catalog of traits - 'physical attributes', 'sense of humor', 'intelligence', 'loyalty', 'jealousy level' and so on. And when she had finished, she was satisfied with her 'Risono Kareshii'- Ideal boyfriend on paper. Unbeknownst to her, the underground experiment created a Robot lover and sent the package to her house.

The robot lover had all the specifications she had asked for. But guess, what? She found him super annoying. "Night-o kun", the robot-o lover, acted according to his programmed traits, had very little self-awareness and continued to piss off her girlfriend. But when life's challenges came, he was a consistent and loyal presence to her. He cooked for her. He did odd jobs for her. After all, he had beyond human strength and could work over time without breaking, and would still get home and greet her with a big smile on his face. He had such a great demeanor! Except for when he was jealous of the boss that Riiko had subconsciously had a crush on. But she asked for a "jealous lover"! Haha.

So that I won't give too much away, I'll go straight to a pivotal point in the series. Riiko found herself in the middle of the street with a car rushing towards her. Night-o had a rival robot who was supposedly stronger, smarter, "more mature". The scene went into slow motion and went to show the mind and thinking process of the rival robot. In the rival robot's computer mind, it calculated the risk vs rewards of making a certain choice. It had calculated that the probability that she would win Riiko's heart would shoot to the roof, if he rushes to pick her up. But that would also mean he could die. In the end, he stopped himself and just watched her.

Night-o, on the other hand, didn't even think, he just rushed in to save her. With Riiko in her arms, it seemed that Night had damaged himself beyond repair. When he saw Riiko was safe, he let out a faint smile and then his system shut down. The roboticist who invented him tried to do an on-site repair. They fixed Night but they found something. He wasn't acting on his program anymore. He saved Riiko despite knowing the damage that could cause him.

---------------

Night became a robot that had "consciousness". In the succeeding days, he still tried to do what he usually did but he often overheated and collapsed. His machine mind on a chip could not take the computational requirements of typical human consciousness as we know it.

This reminds me of when Janet ("an anthropomorphized vessel of knowledge, AI") in "The Good Place" broke when she developed complex feelings for Jason and got jealous when he was getting married to Tahani!

These are all fiction. How about reality? We know of AI systems that could beat the best humans in chess and Go. In a nutshell, systems were trained on millions (or even more) of games, and are self-learning systems that get better with each game they have with humans. Because of machine computational power and memory that is greater than the human brain, they are able to make inferences from the current position of the board, and think several steps ahead. [Alpha Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y), does this with two kinds of complex networks. It's like having [two minds](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphago-zero-starting-scratch) making computations at the same time. One, is called the 'policy network' which from my understanding is like, 'opponent moves piece in this spot, I have a response to this'. It's like if the opponent, checks your king, the response is known to be, either, move the King to a safe square, or shield the King with another piece. The other mind is called, `value network`. At each position of the board, the AI calculates the most probable winner.

-----------------

Lee Sedol, then ranked the best Go player in the world was made to play a best of five tournament against [AlphaGo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y). He lost. But he won one game which astonished me.

In that game, Lee Sedol made a move that was totally bizarre and unexpected. It was a move that surprised the spectators. It wasn't a bad move. It was just not a "textbook move", i.e. a move that one would usually make given the situation. In fact, the longer the Go players spectators thought about it, it seemed like an astonishingly good move according to my fuzzy memory - a move that only a "messy and creative" human brain could make.

AlphaGo took a while to calculate the next move. And for some reason, it began to act weirdly - making decisions that for a lack of a better term was, "out of character". Lee Sedol's "creative move", broke AlphaGo. It made AlphaGo go crazy in that game because it hadn't seen and learned a move like that and didn't know what to do. It was the only game Lee Sedol won, but it made a mark on me. It seems like AIs could also get "confused".

----------------------

Confusion. It happens when we're in a state where we couldn't make sense of what is happening to the world around us. Sometimes, it is benign and resolves itself. Sometimes, it is a symptom of a larger problem. Perhaps a mismatch between "expectations" of what should occur in the outer world vs what actually happens in reality.


Could this be the reason why we as humans fall into "dark nights of the soul?" Is it when our mental models of the world could no longer accurately describe what we are experiencing? Is this why some people have "rigid beliefs" in God or about themselves are subconsciously trying the best they could to protect their mental models, i.e. if those beliefs are gone, the world would make no sense and it would break them?

----------------------

A few months ago I wrote about my own experiences where my mental models broke. "I’ve had some times where I would go through a long hermit mode, “Dark Night of the Soul” which was something I thought was beyond depression. It was beyond a biochemical imbalance which could be restored by medication. But in extreme cases was needed and helped me endure the nights last year. It’s more of like an emergent phenomenon beyond the individual components - the physical, mental, your biochemistry, your feelings, your consciousness, subconscious."

I talked about how writing helped a lot and how writing helped me organize and make sense of my own experience of the world. But I have to emphasize. Writing alone wasn't enough for me. Talk therapy with a counselor was also not enough. I think 80 percent of the problem was a physical issue - i.e. more mental confusion happens, and the rigidity of our mental models often occur when the physical brain itself is unwell. The rigid mental models come in the form of thinking loops, and sympathetic nervous system overrides that were seemingly hardwired. I had to reprogram them. I *wanted* to reprogram them. But before I could do that, I had to "nourish" my fatigued and 'broken mind'.

The 'dark night of the soul' first and foremost, is the 'dark night of the brain'.
------------------------

So what do we do to prevent these dark nights? Or should we surrender? What is the neurobiological basis of "surrendering"?

-------------------------

I think the reason why we like narratives and watching shows is because they have a resolution. Unfortunately, [life doesn't make narrative sense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2U7k7aPKue0) all the time. But perhaps we do have some power on how we want our life story to unfold despite the uncontrollables.

-------------------------
P.S. I haven't forgotten about the things I said I will write about. Also, I will write about them because I kinda really want to. Using up too much mental bandwidth if I don't write them down.

# Correlated Stuff and Comorbidities

After my weekly thursday UACMS meeting, I attended a painting class. I had a good time but I started to feel a little headache. I had wondered whether I was being 'overstimulated' socially or it was just hot, or I haven't eaten or it was something else. I've been feeling pretty well lately and I could handle social interactions without getting too tired (and actually enjoying social interactions)! And I was pretty productive at work too! So from the things I've been reading, this could have been blood sugar related or a heart-rate/hypertension issue. There's a joke among people that you're not supposed to google your symptoms and suddenly think "Oh, shit! I must have cancer!". But I think it should be a practice that we learn about our bodies and how we could treat them well so that we could have energy for the things and people that matter to us. I think it helps me. And we shouldn't have to wait for a BIG ILLNESS by the time we take care of ourselves. That's not necessarily obvious because the payoff of a yummy cake, the sugar high is immediate compared to the long-term TERRIBLE consequences of having diabetes and/or even alzheimer's.

When the consequences are not apparent, it's not easy to stop a bad habit. Doctors are humans and are prone to errors in diagnosing and proposing a treatment protocol. And while there are "precision" methods, looking at specific biomarkers, PET scans, xrays and so on, we don't always catch the right illness. And sometimes, the treating them mean a lifetime of depending on medication/s that is/are way beyond the economic capacities of people. What's a right illness anyway? What if there are several? There are so many free parameters!

Even the way personality tests are designed and taken has a lot of bias in them - even if you say you are answering them "honestly". I believe that like taking blood tests, the results of these tests must "also" be seen as a snapshot of who you are in a moment. I know that there are studies that purportedly show that personalities are relatively stable over time (full disclosure: I haven't read the actual papers). It sort of makes sense because even if the brain is "plastic", i.e. you can change your brain, but you can only change it to some degree depending on how "healthy" your brain is.

Anyway, I rambled again. My mum said I was a pretty blabby baby so many said I spoke "German". LOL. Back to the blood sugar or hypertension issue. To address the problem, I ate some nuts. And ate cottage cheese with olives and veggies. They were supposed to bring back up my blood sugar level (if my hunch was right). I felt good but there was still a little bit of a headache. So my protocol when I feel bad is that I listen to it and then stop to take a breather. I did my breathing protocol again. I used to do 478 respirations but now doing the Wim Hof method with training for breath retention.

So my hypothesis last time was that I get this "bad feeling" related to shallow breathing. I tried something different though. (See, I'm not really systematic in my hypothesis testing. I am more focused on feeling well.) I sucked in more air/oxygen than I normally would during the circular breathing part, and I was able to go past 1 minute in breath retention, and even reached 1 min 31 s.

Anyway, weirdly enough, as I'm addressing mostly my RA flares and my so-called "bipolarity", some adjustments in my "practice" lead to an overall feeling of wellness, vitality. My breathing feels well. I don't have much anxiety. I have more mental energy. I could talk to people with a big smile again. I have more focus and ability to learn new things! I feel like myself again! Even the mild dermatitis/psoriasis like thing I have on my forehead has disappeared. They seem to be all interlinked. I'm soaking in as much information as I can from "easy sources" first and perhaps do data analysis and make more refined experiments without hurting myself. You know the bipolarity thing could just have been a blood sugar issue, ya know. I'm not taking lithium now and I'm fine!!! I wish I had the knowledge to argue with my doctors, that we should have ruled out the easier stuff first before they gave "lifelong" or long term medication. The meds didn't even solve the underlying issue/s. They just mask the symptoms. Just like what the "poop guy physicist" said, take the medication during a crisis or the peak of the illness until you can go the "natural route" - i.e. lifestyle changes.

But then again, I "forgive" my doctors (lol) since they are only human and were acting according to the best of their knowledge. That is why I think critical thinking should be a muscle that should be practiced, with feeling, I must say, in processing information. Nothing is ever truly rational. And not every feeling gives us accurate assessments.

--------------------

In my next post, I'll talk about some "prescriptions" on how to fix a broken brain. ( Well, it depends. Maybe I'll surprise you and talk about something else.)
