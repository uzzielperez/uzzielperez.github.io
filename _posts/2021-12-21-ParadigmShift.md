**"He who has a strong Why to live can bear almost any how"** - Viktor Frankl

Last Friday I had a chat with [Caroline Kant](https://esperare.org/en/caroline-kant). I listened intently to what she had to say about the landscape of patient-centric medical research. Merely listening to her and learning from her experiences and stories made me say to her "Wow, I feel happy..." three times in the span of an hour. It's funny how that at that day I had no better vocabulary than "happy", knowing how verbose and blabby I am, at least internally in my head.  But again, I forgive myself as my brain circuits have been a little fried from my weird immune system. I felt genuinely happy and humbled chatting with her.

I learned about certain data gaps in various illnesses. She made two remarks that struck me. One, there are behavioural markers of multiple sclerosis relapse and second how standard clinical trials may not be capturing data on what is actually helping patients in their real life. For example, for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, one way to measure "success" is to see how well a patient has walked x meters. If the patients/participants of the study succeeded at the test at that moment then the drug "passes" the test. But then we have very little information on how the family and the patients are coping on a daily basis.

She shared with me a lot more than this but I'm still processing them and also taking notes in my private journal. Again, "I am happy".

The EspeRare foundation focuses on orphan diseases. One of the most known orphan diseases is something called "Sickle Cell Disease" - a blood disease where the red blood cells are shaped weirdly, like a sickle. This produces a host of problems for someone who has it and here I quote a page from the [National Center of Translational Sciences](https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/8614/sickle-cell-anemia): "the sickle cells also get stuck in blood vessels, blocking blood flow.[1] Signs and symptoms of sickle cell disease usually begin in early childhood and may include anemia, repeated infections, and periodic episodes of pain (called crises)."

I also made a good friend in [David Issom](https://ashpublications.org/thehematologist/article/doi/10.1182/hem.V15.5.8892/462968/Mind-Over-Matter-One-Person-s-Journey-From-Patient). Someone you would say is a hero for many when it comes to advocating for changes in healthcare and giving a voice to patients. He was a personal support for me, someone I bugged a lot during some of my health crises the past month.

I asked him how he had managed all these years and he had told me about how self-awareness, doing causal analyses and self-experimentation helped him a lot. I recommend this conversation with Dr. Julie Kanter, the Director of Sickle Cell Research at the Medical University of South Carolina - "[Mind Over Matter: One Person's Journey From Patient to Change-Maker](https://ashpublications.org/thehematologist/article/doi/10.1182/hem.V15.5.8892/462968/Mind-Over-Matter-One-Person-s-Journey-From-Patient)"

This year was a massive year of existential crisis for me. My normal treatments stopped working for me for some reason and I felt I was not as strong as I used to be. Part of me wants to retire back home to the Philippines. Part of me wants to stay in Europe and take advantage of the fertile intellectual ground for innovation and the opportunities. Part of me wants to go back to the United States, finish my contract and my PhD and be with my support system. I have decidedly chosen one path in the next few months, one that I would categorize as "surefooted steps of growth".

But whichever path it is, I feel have something that helps me get up in the morning even if my body feels like a [sloth](https://www.scmp.com/news/world/article/1835589/energy-saving-pandas-are-sluggish-sloths-study-finds) or [panda](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3154929/Panda-s-aren-t-lazy-ve-got-underactive-thyroid-Low-nutrient-bamboo-diet-leaves-mammals-feeling-lethargic.html) that has a malfunctioning thyroid. (No wonder, those weirdo animals are freaking lazy! Dailymail article just for entertainment purposes.)

Caroline and David are two people who inspire me. Two people who turned their personal pains into projects that help other people. In the end, our own suffering isn't just about us, but also people who feel lost and are clinging on to some hope for living and being well.
