Not all cancers are the same. Some cancers are more aggressive than others. Some cancers are highly treatable and in fact could be classified as "curable" when detected early.
People who live with the disease are told to think "positively" and shift one's mindset when it comes to a cancer diagnosis. "Cancer is a manageable disease". It sucks but it is manageable, they say.
You treat it like any challenge. You live one day at a time doing as best as you can. You can even think of cancer as not just as a crisis but an opportunity. However, that is some form of wisdom that is hard to live by.

There is no definitive proof that "mindset" changes the outcome of cancer treatments. The outcome depends on the biology of the progression of the disease and what treatments are available. Advances in immunotherapy,
biomarker testing, genomic sequencing, precision surgery give hope to advance stage cancer patients. In addition, openness to integrative and complementary approaches are also what makes life more tolerable. You not only want to extend the number of years or months the person has but also the person's quality of life. You still want to laugh, to be with people you love, to be able to enjoy a little bit. You not only want to remove the tumor, you also want the person to have psychosocial support, to know what to do in the absence of a doctor and a cure, to find some relief.

I remember how Steve Jobs said he had regretted not going for surgery early on when he got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. He instead opted for herbs and all the alternative approaches saying that he didn't want his body to be "violated". But given what I've learned right now, an integrative approach - combining traditional western medicine and eastern medicine is important. Once you remove the tumor, how do you stay in remission?

There are important questions to ask though. Who is the doctor operating on you? What is the doctor's complication rate - i.e. from the doctor's history how many developed complications after surgery? Are there any crucial areas that are going to be affected? Is targeted therapy an option? In elective surgery one considers both safety and speed.

What do you do when there is no cure? Doctor's don't know everything. Every patient's story is different. There is real life data. There is classical scientific knowledge. Being aware of both helps you make decisions that you feel is right for you.
