“Let everything happen to you: Beauty and terror. Just keep going: No feeling is final" - Rainer Maria Rilke

Some time last week after work, I attended a short Zoom talk by Sharon Terry that was about "Patient's driving their own health". I've heard about Sharon's work from EspeRare foundation's Caroline Kant. I was deeply inspired by her work with Genetic Alliance. She briefly recalled her deep moment of fear and terror when her kids were diagnosed with a rare disease during the interview. She also shared that same story during her popular [TEDMED](talk) aptly titled "Science didn't understand my kids' rare disease until I decided to study it".

Some researchers had drawn blood from her two kids and then another group had asked if they could draw blood from them again. "Why don't you just ask to share from the previous group?" to which the second research cohort replied "What? We don't share! We're competing". For Sharon, that was unconsciolable. So she and her husband went on this journey to learn everything about their children's rare genetic disease, extracted the gene that caused the disease and eventually formed *[Genetic Alliance](https://esperare.org/en/sharon-terry)* - "a network of more than 10,000 organizations, including 1,200 disease advocacy organisations. Genetic Alliance enables individuals, families and communities to become full participants in translational research."

Recently, Genetic Alliance had formed a partnership with [LunaDNA](https://www.lunadna.com/) a platform that allows patients to securely share their genetic data and medical records to drive breakthroughs in medical research. LunaDNA was develeoped by [LunaPBC](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/lunapbc) - which is a "Public Benefit Corporation". It is a for-profit corporation that "was established to reshape the traditional research model to effectively, efficiently, and responsibly power medical breakthroughs by putting people at the center of health."

I've been interested in learning more about the "unsiloed" translational medicine landscape as I'd like to move in this direction after I graduate. While I'll be slowing down in this aspect because I'll be focusing on my health, focusing on my dissertation and nurturing certain relationships, I find it worth making small weekly investments in reading and connecting with people who have the same mission. Although I no longer strongly believe that I have to live for something larger than myself like some "grand purpose", I still find some comfort in being with people who want to live in the same spirit and ethos. It makes me feel less lonely.

There is no grand "wisdom". There is no grand "ethos". But we can decide how we want to live the rest of our days to the best of what our biology affords us.

Sharon's children are about my age and are showing some signs of their disease progressing - their eyes faltering, their hearts weakening. But they had grown to develop their own wisdom. During their teens they told their parents "You have to stop worrying about making a difference, making an impact and instead like us, learn to live with disease, rather than fight it." Radical acceptance. Resignation. Acceptance of reality. They ironically come together with hope. This is where we start to move forward.
