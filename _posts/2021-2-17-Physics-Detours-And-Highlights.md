I find that the tasks I need to carry out become more interesting to me when I don't just pummel my way through completing them.
I've found it enjoyable to learn new things along the way, try new things out, or look at things from another point of view! Even if it takes longer to finish the actual task, I love looking at things with a pair of new eyes! Of course, I still sometimes get bored but maybe I can intentionally to reintroduce some novelty.

Some highlights and detours:

* I recently signed up to be a Technical Shifter at CMS to support Operations for Detector Upgrades. I was mainly here for Software Upgrades but I've decided to volunteer given the lack of personnel due to the pandemic. I think this is a good way to get to know the system better as well. I feel like the code becomes less abstract when you sort of see the thing your working on. A colleague showed me around 904 as well!

* I worked on another Beyond the Standard Model physics analysis since 2018. Experimental physics papers take a while to finish. I'll be reusing some of the code for my main analysis which is more of a precision test. I'm a little nervous now that I'm still behind my original timeline. :P

Whenever I ask myself whether my work was meaningful, i.e. talking to computers and detector systems, I remind myself of that usual script that CERN scientists and engineers use for PR: "We're pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and technology... We're learning about the universe and we're doing it in a multicultural environment, working with different people, in different parts of the world." :'(
I've been questioning this abstract sense of meaning. It somehow feels... empty. And it makes me question, is this field for me?

It's a "BIG MEANING" that still holds true but is not always as powerful a motivator for me during the pandemic. For me, I found joy in conversing with the few times I get to see people at the control room, us exchanging our frustrations and jokes about work. (With COVID19 precautions of course!) I found joy in discovering a new way to solve a coding problem or if there's a new way for me to visualize something. These are really small every day things. It's not just found in the prestige of working in a known institution.

I promised myself that I want to write more physics documentation, with my usual work process observations, for this year. Even if I do it compulsively to make up for the slow rigmarole process of publishing a [CMS physics analysis](https://cms.cern/content/publishing-analysis).
