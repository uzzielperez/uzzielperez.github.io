Do you remember one of the classic Zen [stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3P7f0Zg9wk) about a farmer who had a series of misfortunes happen to him? To cut the long story short, he was given as an "example" of how to deal with life's misfortunes - with a sense of stoicism and equanimity, perhaps mental and emotional states that you get only with age. Or is it?

Let me retell the story. Adding more details and assumptions in the parable retelling I did [here](https://uzzielperez.github.io/life,/pleasant/thoughts/series/2020/07/01/Chamonix-Mont-Blanc2.html).

There is this classic story of a farmer who had a horse he loved so much. For some weird reason, it ran away and a nosey neighbor offered his condolences and told him “That’s so unfortunate! This is terrible for you. You won’t be able to till the land and live!”

The farmer replied: “Maybe. Could be good. Could be bad. We shall see.”
**The farmer returned to his resting place. Sighed. Knowing that misfortunes pass he knew on a "rational" level that this is so. But a sense of grief and loss as good memories with the beloved horse return, which in turn made him teary-eyed - a physical response made to tranquilize the body in times of stress.**

The next day, the farmer’s son had broken his leg. One of the horses threw him to the ground. The same nosey neighbor said “What a tragedy! Your son won’t be able to help with the land. You must be devastated!”.

Again, the farmer replied: “Maybe. Could be good. Could be bad. We shall see.” **But then when he returned to his resting place he sighed a little harder. An image of the future plays in his head - more work individually for him just to produce the same amount of food and most importantly take care of the needs of his son. A sense of anxiety and fear briefly takes over him as he knows the limitations of his aging body."**

The farmer experiences a series of unfortunate events. Each time he **verbally** responds in the same way. Now this is a hypothetical man. There might be some man who have weird nervous systems not capable of feeling anything at all. But I assumed that this man "felt" things too. What he did with the feelings, I leave open to the readers's imagination. Does he make it worse? Or does he have the skills to make things better?

Perhaps, in growing older, one feels a sense of **confidence** in *overcoming* adversity. [Debbie Millman](https://www.creativeboom.com/features/debbie-millman/) said "confidence is achieved through repeated success". But how do you get to that point when you feel failure is most likely to happen? How do you grow to a zen old man like him and actually survive the damages along the way? If the next misfortune was a "physical illness" to him, having technically no one to farm the land, will he and his son survive *on their own*?

I wasn't able to follow through on the experiments I wanted to do [initially](https://uzzielperez.github.io/physics/2021/02/28/Joie-de-vivre.html) since Nirmal died. It made me think about "misplaced grit". But now I think I have the renewed sense to try them out again. *I want to be able to live well.*  The goals are quite lofty here and non-specific. So I've decided to limit my experiments to "neurobiological/immunological" experiments focused on my body. Largely because I felt my arthritis (RA) has been set off lately and I see a pattern emerging as to when I usually get them. Right now, I am on week two (the results I might publish later, "we shall see"). I hope I can find some answers that lead to a sense of well-being or in like what I said 'feeling alive'. As for the physics, *j'avais la tête dans le guidon* on weekdays! Consistency, new system, with my style. Excited but also ironically, grounded.  

A part of this project is writing a self-Cliff-Notes of things I've learned about adversity, how we cope, how we protect ourselves, what *breaks* us, how we deal with pain (the emotional and the physical kind are one and the same) and what makes us grow. Could we reverse "injuries"? Why do ridiculous laugh therapies work? Do we really have "free will" if we were hardwired to react a certain way? How do we grow if we have "Boundaries"? Why and when do we "break"? Are the importance of having "values" and having the ability to change our minds contradictory things? If someone's mental models of the world are more rigid, do they suffer less or does that help them? Is having a sense of self really that important? Is the way we do science the only way to seek what's true? *Could we fine-tune ourselves to survive in this world?* When will Taylor Swift put out her new surprise album? Does she and Bon Iver guy need a new crisis to write songs?

I am attempting to answer them in a series of posts limiting myself to 30-60 minutes of writing at a time - otherwise, I won't publish it because it will be too "big" for me. Part of my experiment in trying out the idea that "if you make it easy", it gets done. *Et, voila, le premier post!*
