Repetition. I thought of the things that come easily for me. In the morning, I had made it a habit to fix my bed, wash my face and brush my teeth. Also night, it's a habit to get to clean up to get clean. Also, one of the most pleasurable things to do is my afternoon/night walk (I can't run yet).

At one of my favorite spots in the city, just before the Batie Woods, you can find the River Rhone and Arve merge at the La Jonction. You can also the Jet d'Eau if it is powered on. And at the background, you will see the Alps. The River Rhone is turqoise and clear while the Arve is murky and looks almost violent. But that is where I find people riding their kayaks and inflatables. I had always thought that the Rhone was the one that extends to the Mont Blanc side in Chamonix, but was surprised I saw the Rhone instead. I wonder if I just decided to jump into the Rhone if it had taken me to Geneva for free rather than buying another bus ticket. So, seeing these nice things, it is easy for me to get out for a daily walk. Recently, I've learned there's a way where you could get down really close to the Rhone. And there I've sat down a bunch of times to do some bird watching.

I've also learned, that at a walking pace, I could listen to a french audiobook comfortably. So far, that has been the most effective way for me when it comes to learning practical phrases. Podasts are good too. But I really try to spend most of the time just relaxing and listening to music.

There are things that don't always come easy for me. On the intermediate level, it takes a little bit of willpower to get me to exercise unless I've been on a streak. Getting to work also takes a little bit of power. The easy tendency is to avoid it but I have tried a trick of *setting the mood* such that my mind doesn't think I'm always going against the flow. And after a while of getting used to this, I have found *some kind* of work, that I have done repeatedly for the past month to be a source of pleasure in itself rather than a source of frustration. Getting to work, in it by itself, becomes an easy trance. I try to focus on one task or problem at a time. And it feels nice. Just like floating down the river.

But getting to this point takes some time. Takes some repetition. A difficult maneuvre, let's say tying ropes, playing a piano piece or some fancy football/soccer footwork can look really easy watching an expert do it. And the moment you try it first, it is hard and frustrating. *Doesn't look right.* *Doesn't sound right.* *Doesn't feel right.* But you want to be able to do it! So you carry on and try again and again and again until it becomes easy. Sometimes, you need to take a break from trying. Sometimes, you ask yourself are the frustrations worth it? Is this thing worth learning? Is this thing worth getting right? Worth the try though. Anyway, I think this is how I learned to tie my shoes. Repetition.

But once you are merely lulled in the comfort of repetition, the learning of anything new or difficult could stop. But I guess, I just have to decide how much I want things to be easy and relaxed. And how much frustration, at the beginning, I am willing to put up with.

Second point about mastery. When doing a maneuvre or some kind of calculation, I have noticed something. It seems like they were not meant to be done speedily at first. When I tried to learn Iniesta's *La Croqueta*, I tried to do it as fast as he did but that didn't get me anywhere. So I slowed down the video, carefully watched and copied each step until I got it and did it faster and faster. I did it again and again on my own, until one day I had used it in a game, *without thinking*! And the Bangladeshi guys had laughed at the guy I had left behind. (We always laugh and make sounds when we see something peculiar in the game. I remember I've also learned the Zidane roulette and did it in a game where some people were watching. Felt good and am just bragging now! :) ). Similarly, when I was first doing some physics calculations, I had thought of calculating things in my head. But my physics professor was adamant, "no write it down first,  so each step is clear." And once those steps become clear, and you've done it enough times, things will become *second nature* to you.

*Quick Thinking!* Think of a comedian who seems to be really quick in saying a joke or two! Seemingly without any sort of preparation but the reality, it took years of cracking jokes and thinking of funny thoughts to create a comedian. Alan Watts talks about this in [one of his stories](https://youtu.be/u0GwZgG3vrQ).

I have been thinking about these things for a while now but I had only been able to write these things down in my notebook while on the bus to Chamonix. As I said, some work for me has become easy and fun to do. But there are still some work that I find frustrating and difficult. Something I wanted to escape. And I wanted to know if there was any way for me to learn to enjoy more, and get past the tedious and difficult moments more quickly. I don't have a real answer. But I have decided that when I am tired, I will not push myself to work more, unless I cannot let go of my progress. I will just rest and try again the next day. Until it becomes easy.

Am trying to write down the thoughts that I've disentangled during the break. Perhaps the final set would be on handling pressure, why I am careful about my work methods, [incubation periods in the creative process](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/06/alan-watts-wisdom-of-insecurity-1/), and finally "birds and the things that fool our brain".
