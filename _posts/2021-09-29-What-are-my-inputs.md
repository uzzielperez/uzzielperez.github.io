Back in 2015, we got to the finals of a one-night amateur soccer tournament. We were playing against a better team but we were able to defend well and get to the penalty shoot out. Back then I was kind of sick and not in my element. And in the other team they also had another "girl" but she was way younger than me and played for the Philippine National Team for a while. She was damn good!

The other team went first. Penalties 1-4 all went in for both teams. The other team let the girl take the penalty. Predictably, it went in. But then it was my turn. I was nervous. I stood behind the ball. The whistle blew. I kicked the ball and it went off the ground. A few seconds later, it was in the hands of the keeper. My penalty was saved. We lost the game.

I wasn't an experienced penalty taker. I lacked conviction and I also lacked the proper form when it comes to kicking the ball with power and proper placement. Psychologically, I was also not confident. I knew I was not "practiced" in the art of penalty kicks. I felt incredibly terrible that night. I was kind of harsh to myself when I was younger. My inner Pep Guardiola admonished me.

So I do understand what Eckhart Tolle meant when he said, "the vehicle is not prepared". The body and mind is not "wired" for the task. It hasn't been trained. So even if he was using "New Age Mumbo Jumbo", I knew what he meant when I read some of his books. I just had a different language.

Sometimes we misunderstand people because they have a different way of expressing things. Perhaps they also have a different lens by which they experience the world. The way something that has been said "lands differently" for different people. A friendly jab is perceived as an insult. But for another friend it is nothing and is funny. What is "ok" for one person may not be ok for another. We all have differently wired "nervous systems".
