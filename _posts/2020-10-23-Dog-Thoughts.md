The past few nights where I was getting home past midnight were the kind of "tired but satisfied" kind of nights. But I think, this would be the last night as I have requested for a break or a "slowing down". I think it's reasonable as I've made some progress on things. Still behind our original timeline but am trying to live that "presence over productivity" principle from Alan Watts. It has made a key difference in how I live and work.

But tonight's thoughts were sort of different. I had asked myself "*What if I had a dog?*". I would like to have a dog. A dog gives you company, is normally attuned to your emotions, both positive and negative. Would having a dog make the quality of my life much better than it is now? I imagined how it can but I also imagined the responsibility of owning and taking care of one.

Then a weird thought had come to mind. "*What if I was living in the streets, homeless, and I had a dog?*". If someone had offered me a place to stay in exchange for the dog, would I accept the offer?
Assume that I love the dog. It has been with me through the good and the bad times. Would I let it go?

They say that up to some threshold, better material conditions do make people happier and they get a better chance for self-actualization. But would I give up the dog for that? I had thought, if the person would give the dog a better life.. I probably will. But then again, how much would I suffer in the absence of the dog and if the dog loved me, would it suffer too? Would we both just suffer being apart? Or can I convince myself that such a situation is better, and that the dog will be happier anyway with a new human and a nice place to stay?... Or given the impermanence of things, I could tell myself one of us would eventually depart and we'd be apart - forever.

I think our minds can conjecture what we'll feel. But they are not always accurate predictions our future feelings. In this hypothetical scenario, am not 100 percent sure what it'll be. All I know is, I do not have a dog right now.
