This will be an evolving note on experiments to increase VO2 Max and Longevity and what the whole process means to me spiritually.
These are my ideals and when I veer away from these, there are observable negative effects to my lack of consistency. I'm not proud of days I eat crazy puffs but those days still exist. They're pretty good though!

## Mental, Emotional, Spiritual
* Reading 
* Journaling. Stream-of-consciousness writing. 
* Meditating at least 10 minutes a day. Combine with some movement on days I do longer meditations. There are immediate measureable effects on Heart Rate Variability with 6-6 breathing pattern 
* Side-effects of meditations are real and there are ways to mitigate them. See this good podcast episode with Tim Ferriss and Dr. Willoughby Britton [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdmvoX1RZWA)
* Spending time with community, friends helps reduce Tachykinins. Sometimes these people make me feel better. Sometimes worse. But I don't blame anyone. 
* Subconscious reprogramming - whatever that means 
* Spending time with nature. Consciousness. 
* Creative Projects

## Physical Activity 
2022-2023
* Crawling, yoga, and 30 minutes of walking. Was tough though
* Fall 2023 I was able to cycle more regularly maintaining Zone 2

As of May 23, 2024

* Min 90 minutes of walking everyday when not cycling
* At least 45 minutes of Zone 2 Cycling (I invested in a fitness tracker) 2-3 times per week 
* Norwegian 4X4 four times (or start with 2 times) once a week. Four minutes of intense pedalling reaching Zone 5, and 3-4 minutes of rest. Not to be done when HRV < 50.
* Yoga, Dancing, Exercise Snacks 
* 2x a week Strength training (Would like to increase to 2019 level)

Aiming to play soccer again. 
    
## Nutrition

### Food 

* Mostly Plant-based but I do occasionally eat chicken and beef. 
* In the process of shifting to 3-5 days of low-carb/ ketogenic diet. Carbo loading on heavy cycling days

### Supplements
Cheapest version I could afford nowadays

* Low-dose lithium (neuroprotective and antiviral effect)
* Vitamin D 
* Glycine / Collagen 
* Protein (1 g per lb of body weight)  
* Lion's Mane Mushroom Supplement (Stamets Stack with Niacin) 
* Vitamin B Complex 
* Vitamin C 
* Magnesium 
 

## Medicine

* Still better to be vaccinated. There's a big difference in recovery times. 
* Lowest possible dose to control inflammation and minimize side effects
