*Note: In Star Trek Discovery, there exists a Mycelium Network which seems to be a stand-in for the Large Scale Structure of the Universe. No just kidding. Haven't gotten to that part yet because I decided to watch a more intellectually stimulating show called "Too Hot to handle". It's no. 1 in Switzerland. This is probably the last quarantine diary barring any second wave which I hope does not happen in any universe or alternate timelines.*

### Day 41:

So today I've learned to feel weird and feel that it's ok to be slightly productive. I've learned to get past minimum, recalibrate my inner world and be a little more than ok. Not entirely super "happy" ok, but just enough recalibration that my internal state is in equilibrium. Thank you Russell Brand!

Next thing I would like to learn - how to grow a beard.

-------

I usually go out for a walk when the sun is setting. Filipinos hate the sun to be honest. Because, it feels like you could literally fry an egg on the streets during these months. These "white" people are super strange because they like the sun here.

One time I made a mistake of doing my "allowed-social-distancing" walk on a Sunday and I saw naked people on the grass. I was shookt. Apparently, it is normal here, my room mate said. She said I should expect more in the summer. She even told me the place to go if I wanted a higher count. I said, I am not super interested. She said she doesn't believe me. I said, "It's true! If I want conversations I can't just bug a naked person and start small talking to her."

Anyway, today, there were some social-distancing violators in the park doing a "choog-choog" party. You know, like loud music and using their cellphone light to mimic dance floor lights! I didn't know enough French to say "Vous ne douvez pas danser ici!"

But if they asked me to join... I would considered joining because I am so so desperate for hooman interaction! Ha!


### Day 43:

The science on the minimum distance for social distancing is not conclusive. This podcast [episode](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5mGJge83alu3cbMEgFmQ1o?si=JSoekrMLTiqnzjQ0sIqgyA) from Radiolab has a great discussion on this.

Humans are so disgusting.


### Day 44:

My mama was telling me that they have received a plastic full of rice, two cans of Old Town Sardines and Payless Mami Noodles. They were told that the relief goods were good for two weeks. Meanwhile in the other town, the Mayor gave away chickens.. no not the roasted kind. They were alive.

You'd have to pluck the feathers and kill the chicken yourself before you can consume them.

### Day 45:

I have started listening to Nordic music and Irish music. I remember my boss who is Irish asked me if i listened to Irish music... I responded, "Yes I do. When I was in grade school I listened to West Life a lot." He laughed. I didn't understand why.

Yes, in the Philippines, English-language music reached the mountains and some remote areas.

### Day 46:

I was trying to find my center and decided to draw a happy smiling Buddha.

<img alt="buddha" src="{{ "/assets/img/badbuddha.png" width="20" height="20"| prepend: site.baseurl }}" />



But why does this Buddha look evil and have advanced Rheumatoid Arthritis?


----

Yesterday, I finished two boxes of chocolates and my head wasn't super slow because I woke up with only 5-6 hours of sleep. Because I was tracking tornadoes hitting alabama on twitter. I must have a way to automate this tracking and then send me "pings" without needing to refresh the page.

I've also been trying to answer some physics questions and my code required some overhauling. It was already 2 am and my code was still not compiling. And I just had to leave that shit and sleep.

The last working copy was not committed to github. I was able to recreate the parts I want in the morning. But I learned my lesson. Fix. Commit. Fix Commit. Rinse and repeat. So I don't have start everything from scratch.

If you were looking for a punchline, there is none. This is probably where the nearly parallel universe nearly intersected with our current universe.

### Day 51

I've finally started to walk outside without the need for my knee scooter! I went to this area which was literally the last place I went to before I started early self-isolation (I'm about a week ahead relative to my friends in the US in terms of quarantine days). It's a foresty area with high elevation and it was a challenge with the knee scooter. But now I can climb slopes, slanted less than ~45 degrees. I literally got lost in the woods that I had to speed walk home because I was going to try an online therapy thing. (It's not oversharing to say that I'm in therapy? I hope that it is not a big deal.) And yes, I was kind of singing that Frozen 2 song as well. It's catchy! I don't super like the lyrics though.

Anyway, I got back home on-time for therapy.

A mentor of mine called therapy as some kind of "Personal Debugging". I thought it was an amazing term. But like me when I first delve into a new software, I often end up with more bugs than when I started.

We're going to try again in 2 weeks.


### Day 53 - April 26

***** Writes an emotional heartfelt letter, several pages long....



-------------------------------..... My only fear, is to be disconnected from you....


Letter Addressed to:
Sunrise Telecom Services, Geneva, Switzerland...


### Day 53

My friend is getting a cat. So I sent him this video from [Whiskers R We](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puIcnMfWMyI) to let him know that there is a possibility that if you order one they'd drop in extra 9-14 cats as a bonus.

# Day 54 April 27

Switzerland partially reopens. That means I can get a proper haircut. So after getting groceries, I passed by *Coiffure* and looked at how much a haircut costs. Wait for it.. Wait for it... 60 Swiss Francs..

I'm glad a haircut is not a fundamental human right that I would get riled up about the ridiculous price. So I cut my hair myself once more. And now I look like Kim Jong Un. (Can I say slightly cuter Kim Jong Un? :P And also looks slightly more alive version. As an acquaintance said, *Kim Jong Ill*. Badum tss.)

All this haircut talk reminded me of this scene from the series [Fleabag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q97iIDx-b7U). It's hilarious! Lesson here: *Hair is NOT everything!*

## Day 55

I have been reading about "Scientists turned comedians" and watching some videos on youtube. It's probably a good alternative career. My only problem is I really have a hard time controlling my laugh once I start laughing. I once laughed out loud at a church service when my baby nephew was being baptized and the devil was being asked to leave. But that was in my youth. I think I am a little more respectful and controlled now. Actually a little more spiritual but not in an ordinary, organized-religion kind of sense. Anyway, I don't think I can be a stand-up comedian. I like improv more.

Anyway, one of the reasons I like improv is that it trains me to be a little "looser", be more present, or "in the moment". I plan for almost everything in my life that just being "in the moment" feels like a breath of fresh air. Also, in improv, it's basically a rule to make each other look good. Free self-worth BOOSTER!

## Day 56

This marks the first day that I didn't try to ask anyone "Parlez vous anglais?". I tried to speak french all the way to Gland. Was an essential travel because I was out of meds and the only doctor available at onedoc.ch was at Gland. Had to speak English to the doctor though.

Everyone was nice even if I still spoke broken french. Except there was this one guy who sounded mean at first. When I approached him and asked "pour allez Gland?" he put his hand up and said "Arret! Arret! Deux metre s'il vous plait!". Oops! My bad. I totally forgot about social distancing. "Mais, le train pour Gland c'est ici." So I update my priors and actually think he's a nice guy.

------

When I got to the doctor's office, we did the usual stuff but in the end he asked me "When was the last time you felt really happy?". And then I smiled and I told him I was happy going here, riding the train, and seeing the mountains and the clear lake. But he had to ask me the question again! "When was the last time that you truly felt happy?"

*Happy ugly crying ensues...*

"You monster! What is this a butter commercial?"

-------

Fast forward to after the quarantine, I treated my room mate to dinner in KFC. She taught me how to walk from home through the Bâtie Woods to downtown Geneva. I asked her that question "When was the last time you felt really happy?". And I was completely touched with her answer and I teared up too. While mine was more recent and within the past year, for her it was 8 years ago, before her mum had died. In sharing her happiness, I felt a deep kind of happiness too, based on her memories.

I now realize that that doctor is getting a kick out of asking people this question. He's really a monster. :P

## Day 57

Important [News](https://www.theonion.com/cern-researchers-apologize-for-destruction-of-5-paralle-1819579830?utm_campaign=TheOnion&utm_content=1587744916&utm_medium=SocialMarketing&utm_source=twitter):
CERN has been accused of destroying 5 parallel universes.

---

 I remember in 2016, a bunch of CERN summer students made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jpivwSGZO0) of human sacrifice in front of Lord Shiva. I wonder if they were kicked out of the program, kissed their scientific careers goodbye and started a career in the entertainment industry.

## Day 58

So I got interviewed by a student about my linguistic identity. I had to talk about the languages I spoke well and the ones I'm still learning. I also told him that even if we were colonized by Spain for 300+ years, the recency of the American occupation which was about 40 years made us quite Americanized. Hence, we had English-language songs as Original Pilipino Music (OPM). Here's one famous example - [You are my song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQYA4QsiGX8).

I mentioned to him that there are words peculiar in Filipino that cannot be directly translated to English. Just by saying one or a small number of words, we can make someone laugh and the curtness of it makes me sometimes miss just talking in Tagalog! *Libag*, for instance is sooo funny for us! It's the blackish, dry skin you get from your rubbing yourself when you're dirty and sweaty. It's disgusting and funny at the same time.

----

There are 7000+ islands in the Philippines and we have several local languages back home. They're not just dialects. They're called languages because if for example the Tagalogs conversed with someone who speaks Cebuano, they wouldn't really understand each other. But if you make it "Conyo", you Tagalize it a bit and make it of a higher social status. Typical imperialist Tagalog thinking. This is an example of "Cebuano Conyo" - [If Inside Out was made in the Philippines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9g4gvDpIcA).

----

There's a language called [Chavacano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOcMI5sA4LU) that's quite interesting. It's lexifier is Spanish, i.e. a lot of the words are Spanish but the grammar is distinctively Filipino. There are two variants of Chavacano and they both developed in ports, one in Cavite (Luzon Island) and one in Zamboanga (Mindanao Island). Basically, the traders and the locals had to converse with one another using some Spanish words. But they really couldnt piece the words together in proper Spanish grammar and they ended up with a "bastardized" [version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuLmlHo7Wrk&t=222s).

---

Here is something interestingly peculiar about Filipino (and I think other Austronesian languages) - repeated syllables!

<img alt="bababa" src="{{ "/assets/img/Bababababa.png" width="20" height="20"| prepend: site.baseurl }}" />


I found something similar in French. Some kind of [tongue twisters!](https://www.fluentu.com/blog/french/french-tongue-twisters/).

**Si mon tonton tond ton tonton, ton tonton sera tondu**
*If my uncle shaves your uncle, your uncle will be shaven.*

And from facebook (I forgot the link).

**Un ver vert verse un verre verse un verrier vers vingt heur**
*A green worm pours a glass towards a glassmaker around eight o'clock*

## Day 59

After listening to a recording of my conversation with my best buds (who happen to also be Filipino), I realized that my Filipino accent came out pretty strong. Also, I think *code-switching* or switching languages sort of impairs my speaking ability a little.


Here is an explanation of the origins of our accent and what it actually sounds like if you can't make it out - [Filipino Accent Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BBtS1ir4tA).

-----

On an unrelated note, I just thought about mixed-race/multilingual kids. I have Portuguese and Filipina friends who have twins and the kids have been exposed to English, French, Portuguese and Tagalog afak. If I remember correctly, when they were five, they were pretty resistant to learning Tagalog, although they did love listening to their mom telling them short stories in Filipino.

It's not uncommon that young multiracial kids seem to not have an interest in learning Tagalog. I also know of another kid with a Filipina mom who disliked it. One time she was asked to speak Tagalog and she said "yuck!". She was only four or five. Sad to say, even in the adult world, very few people can speak straight Tagalog or write academic Filipino. Do kids have some kind of internal disdain for Filipino? Or does filipino sound bad?

Well, I have a "theory" which I got from an American guy who's married to an Italian woman. They're raising their kids in the Netherlands. He said that they only speak Dutch and Italian at home.  One time he had observed his son talking to a waitress or someone at the front desk in a hotel/restaurant. He was surprised that he talked to them in English! He said that he thinks that he had observed that the kid has probably observed how powerful the English language is. The kid must have observed his father using English in business and formal settings. When you speak English, it is high status. (Although maybe not necessarily in France!)

So that probably explains why some kids don't like Tagalog!

----

Anyway, I deliberately took majority of my humanities classes in Filipino. It was deliberate on my part so I can communicate academically in it. I haven't really used it lately except for cursing our President in an academic way.

## Day 64

I realize that I'm still largely dependent on my adviser on the big picture and physics strategy of my dissertation.

I learned to be independent from my parents. I can do dis!

## Day 65

I've sort of submitted a code change to the issue I referenced in this [entry](https://uzzielperez.github.io/hcal/upgrades/2020/03/27/Notes-on-ng-Upgrades.html) and [this](https://uzzielperez.github.io/dissertation,/life/2020/04/26/A-Few-Discoveries.html). So, I think I've figured it out. I still need to test it. But I've been allowed to submit a merge request which left a good taste in my mouth. :)

The problem is, the implementation might need to be changed. I would need to work on this issue again since there's a kind of "style" or "philosophy" on how we want to configure and store information. I find that part fascinating. Like there is an "art" to coding.

I just found out that there is such a thing as a [Manifesto for Software Craftmanship](https://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/). I did not sign it.
I feel "well-crafted", "adding value" could be quite arbitrary.

## Day 66

When I am going through something, I try to be careful about passing the weight of my problems to just anyone. Also maybe I'm very wary of who to talk to. But only lately did I learn how to open up in a healthy way (still learning and sometimes I can overdo it!). And with that I have formed beautiful friendships.

----

On passing the weight of problems to someone else, I am reminded of this [dialogue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_tQqymkPdA) from the Movie "Arthur" (Russell Brand version).

Arthur: *Have you ever been in love Hobson?*
Hobson: Yes, I was once... He was from Spain. He asked me to go there with him. You were nearly three.
Arthur: *What happened?*
Hobson: Two days when I was about to leave, I had my bags all packed.. Your father died....
.....
Arthur: *Why have you never told me?*
Hobson: I didn't want you to feel bad.
Arthur: *Why are you telling me now?*
Hobson: I want you to feel bad.

Totally makes sense.

## Day 67

This is just funny. I've discovered the Irish comedian [Aisling Bea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjQSJPadGYM).

## Day 68

I think this is the last entry of the Quarantine Diary. Switzerland has reopened most businesses except for arcade stations and nail salons. Good call.

-----

This diary was inspired by the School of Life's ["On Living in a More Light-hearted way".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTfyrfnwouE)


I wrote this for all the people that I love who are quite far away from me. They had made me feel real happiness, joy and gratefulness, the kind of stuff that deserves to be stored in memory. I have bad memory so I wrote some of those memories down so I won't forget when I'm old. I wish you were a little closer. Here I wish we could just teleport and see each other and not worry about our atoms getting scrambled.

Finally, I want to say, COVID sucks.
