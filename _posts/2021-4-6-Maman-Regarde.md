"Maman, regarde! (Mama, look!)" I've often heard this from children which puts a smile on my face. I don't understand a lot of what kids here say but this is just something that so common that it stuck to me. On some random nth time that I've heard it, I was struck by the realization of how we as adults also get excited to show other people what looked interesting to us! Or perhaps, show something that we're really proud of. Or maybe we just want to be, *considered*. We just want to be seen.

I also once saw a bunch of kids on a merry-go-round. I was trying to listen to their conversation to learn french and I was so amused when a little English girl tried to hop in but the ones who are already on wouldn't let her in. "Quel est le mot de passe?, Quel est le mot de passe (What's the password? What's the password)", one of the louder kids was shouting repeatedly and laughing. It seemed playful though! The kid then said in a softer voice, "Le mot de passe est *Papillion de nuit*". She said it repeatedly to the little English girl. Of course, she didn't understand, so the father intervened and tried to talk to them in English. From the looks of it, he didn't speak understand French. So I just smiled and casually told him, "I think they're asking for a password. Hahaha."

I often find it so amusing how we can learn so much about ourselves from children. How we still, as adults do have that fundamental need to be seen, understood, feel like we belong and feel like people want to play with us. Maslow knew this. Satisfying these higher-order needs are fundamental to our flourishing as human beings.

But even if we will always have that fundamental need to be "seen" even into our adulthood, there is one thing that separates "most" adults from children. It's the ability to see one's own self and beyond. It's the ability to see and understand another person as a fully sentient being, with their own dreams, desires, feelings, intentions and motivations. Somehow fully different from us and also the same in many ways. Seeing and understanding our own needs and wants somehow helps us see others more.
