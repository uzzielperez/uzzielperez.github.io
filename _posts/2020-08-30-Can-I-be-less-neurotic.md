I asked someone I trusted:

> **Can I be less neurotic? I know there are positive aspects to being one. But I think we tend to romanticize this trait and we continue to suffer. I just think there are people who lead beautiful lives, create beautiful things with their neuroticism under control... My best friend is like that.**

My friends called me a few weeks ago and asked me to take this OCEAN personality test which supposedly measures your "Openness, Consciensciousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism." Not reporting my scores here. :P

I have a perception that my 18 yr. old self is less neurotic than my 25 year-old self. My present self is the least neurotic of all the versions of myself. I do not want to return to those older versions. I do not feel less creative now than I was before although I still do think going through those versions was integral to being who I am today - i.e. having an awareness of what's going on in my head, the physical sensations, knowing myself, and having more understanding of what others are potentially going through. And the act of wanting to "make things" had always been a valve for me to release some anxious, neurotic pressure.

Anyway, I have taken the OCEAN test a few months ago and then retook it 2 weeks ago. My neuroticism score went down. By a lot. Could it be because of the life changes I've introduced? Lol. Must have helped that I was cat sitting and staying at the foothills of the Jura. There wasn't a lot of noise inside my head. I felt relaxed. *I felt at peace.*

## Fight or flight

My friend Fen posted a photo of a hall filled with students during the reopening of classes amidst the pandemic.

> **A real concern when I look at this photo: When the human brain thinks your life is at risk, it doesn't have many options to choose from. It can fight, it can run away, it can "fawn" (behave in a certain way designed to appease the aggressor), or it can "freeze" (a numbing response, including depression and catatonia etc.). When you're put in a life threatening situation and these options do not work, or you feel powerless to escape, your response systems can malfunction, and one of the possible results is PTSD. PTSD is a shitty mental illness to have. It leaves you physically ill, mentally overwhelmed, it stresses your relationships... it feels terrible. When the world creates a PTSD trigger in your brain, you are at risk every time circumstances, or someone flips that trigger, and you may have limited control of what your response is. Some people when triggered experience an overwhelming fight response, others might experience freeze to the point of wanting to kill themselves. PTSD changes your capacity to live as you want to in the world, and treatment is patchy at best... When I look at this photo, I see a breeding ground for life-long mental mental illness. I see people in a life threatening situation with very few choices. I don't think folks are really taking that seriously enough, or thinking about the potential for permanent consequences. ** -- Fen Kennedy

 Unless you can utterly convince yourself that the danger is not real, it is probably the case that your sympathetic nervous system got activated. Your heart would have beaten fast, you've felt scared and light-headed. And it is for a good reason. To protect you from danger - perceived or real.

Nowadays, such feelings of anxiety or general feelings of an activated limbic system get triggered by many things. The fear of potentially losing someone you love, feeling generally alone, feeling shamed, being in a dire economic situation. For some people, the brain remains *on guard* for long periods, even if these threatening situations do not "objectively" exist anymore.

When hiking in an unfamiliar terrain, hearing sudden loud sounds in the grass/bushes, can be scary. They could be rattlesnakes or some animal that could cause your death! *The conviction (that you are in danger), could be lifesaving the other one time in a hundred. And in natural selection's calculus, being right 1 percent of the time in matters of life or death can be worth being wrong 99 percent of the time, even if in every one of those ninety-nine instances you're briefly terrified.* (Source: [Why Buddhism is True by Robert Wright](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/8/23/16179044/buddhism-meditation-mindfulness-robert-wright-interview)). From an evolutionary psych perspective, we can understand why we react in certain ways. We can recognize when and why a certain feeling is being felt. Given that much of our natural responses have been pre-programmed since our hunter-gatherer days, they are probably maladaptive in today's settings. For example, leaving our families and beloved friends to have a better financial situation, feels much like leaving our "tribes", which meant our chances of survival would plunge! But in reality, it could be that we will be earning more and gaining new skills. And in today's setup and economy that actually means a better chance at surviving and flourishing.

## Aal Izz Well

One of my favorite scenes from the movie *3 Idiots* is the [scene where Rancho tells the story of a security guard](https://youtu.be/y6Ar-yM5AoU?t=73) in his village. Each night he would holler "*Aal Izz Well*". And each night the people in the village were able to sleep comfortably. But one night there was a robbery and the old security guard was found out. He was actually blind!

But I think the point of the story is clear. *You can fool your heart.* In a good way. That things are going to be all right. But again, take what I say with a grain of salt...

In my university, there were public calls to publicize the COVID-19 cases within the UA system prior to the start of classes. This is to make sure that the University officials and policy makers are acting in good faith. They've finally publicized them in this [dashboard](https://uasystem.edu/covid-19-dashboard). The numbers are quite alarming. 1000+ cases in a small university town. I am one with the calls for transparency, despite *triggering fear*. Knowing, being informed, is a lot better than being kept in the dark. In this way we can fight the pandemic locally less blindly.

When we try to calm ourselves down, there's a tension between being real, accurately knowing the danger out there, and fooling ourselves by trying to find silverlinings in a situation. On an ideal level, we want to be very good at accurately knowing what is "signal" vs what is "noise". We want to be quite good at reducing our false positives in danger detection.

## Treatment, Coping skills and our maladaptive responses

Our maladaptive responses to situations are caused by multiple things. I've already talked about our "pre-programmed" responses. Past experiences, abusive, controlling or neglectful households/relationships, or prolonged exposure to stressful situations rewire our brain in such a way that always keeps us on our toes, scared and stressed "all the time". Classic PTSD. The philosophy of the treatments I've been reading and studying recently have this to say: *We cannot change what happened to us in the past, but we can "rewire" our brains and change the way we feel and respond to similar situations.*

One promising clinical treatment is called [EMDR](https://www.emdr.com/what-is-emdr/). Am in the beginning stages of reading literature on this and trying it myself with the help of a professional. Some of the coping skills like using imagery of a "peaceful and safe space" are things that I've been doing for a long time. But only made more powerful by the act of "tapping" and "bilateral eye movement" and the awareness of one thing - that this is *not escapist*. In my understanding, the idea is we want to be good at "regulation". We want to regulate the response of our limbic system/ sympathetic nervous system. Reason 1: so we become better at discrimating "signal" vs "noise". Reason 2: So we put a stop to the prolonged exposure to unecessary or imagined causes of stress. Reason 3: Controlling our "descent" or spiralling down. All of these are in efforts of having the mental clarity to make proper decisions and actions. These are all nice in theory but really, it takes training.

The same treatment has been used for people who have addiction issues. Usually addiction to harmful substances or certain maladaptive behaviours have been the only way some people could get by. Although, I do not drink alcohol or do drugs, I do have some other behaviours that I wouldn't categorize as healthy. During the height of the lockdown I gorged chocolates and drank bottles of Coke Zero. (Maybe one time I drank a wee bit of alcohol and passed out. Was down an entire day. So not a source of pleasure for me at all.)

Recently, I've also not been drinking Coke or eating that many chocolates. I've no strong need to play upbeat music just to cheer me up. And I massively reduced social media use to less than an hour per week. I've uninstalled the apps. I only look peek like twice a week. The compulsion to check is close to  nil. Am just looking to keep up with the people I care about. I've unfollowed many accounts so that only those I truly care about would appear on my feed whenever I do log in.

I'd like to share the happy place I imagine when I'm feeling in distress. It has always the mountains that grounds me or centers me. Recently, it has been my memory of biking around Crozet, seeing the sun set behind the Jura, the pink skies with the Mont Blanc and other mountain peaks at the opposite side and just feeling the cool breeze.. It felt really peaceful. I've not felt this peace for a long time. And then I tap my heart. There's something about feeling the beat of my own heart that calms me down and makes me feel better. :)
