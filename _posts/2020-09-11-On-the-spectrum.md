In honor of one of the greatest counselors...


**Et tous ces sages ont fait des cases où tous nous ranger**
*And all these wise men have made boxes where we can all fit*

**...On prend des boîtes, on y range les gens qu'au fond jamais, jamais l'on ne comprend**

*We take boxes, we put people in them that we never, ever understand*

I like movies, shows with characters on the autism spectrum. I like Abed in Community. He's the cool guy who likes movies - both watching  and making them and he tries to make sense of the world in people in terms of the characters he watches. I also liked Atypical. While you see the really cool parts of someone with Asperger's syndrome in Abed, in Atypical they show the difficulties too. Like how it feels to get overwhelmed by social situations, not knowing how to respond and having sensory issues and so. And then there's the movie [Adam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92U6OnVZG3U). I probably watched this more than 20 times.

I'm fascinated by these characters and have come across people who are diagnosed with this. I also know people who seem to be in the spectrum but do not have an official diagnosis. It wasn't necessary since they've got the "bad tendencies" managed. Despite having this "thing", I see that they are great scientists/linguists, are excellent communicators and have a great sense of humor. And they are also "kind". So there's a "theory" that it's probably not the case that they don't have empathy. They probably have too much of it so they freeze in some weird social situations. But the one thing we know about them is that they're (sometimes incredibly) visibly socially awkward while some have learned to "mask" them over the years.

As I said, I've met a number of these people and are sort of "drawn" to them. But I've never met someone who worked as a therapist. It's a surprise to me that someone who has "social" issues could connect so well and be good at this kind of job. Someone who's supposedly "mind blind" listens so well and knows when to shut up and when to give inputs. Or I don't know, maybe I just got a good match. A person once told me that you can't really rate if a therapist is good or bad. You can just them based on how they fit with the issues you want to address.

But I guess, him being on the spectrum helped me. He's a well-read nerd so it's nice to have a common language with him. We exchanged TED talks and I told him about the books I read the past two months and it was a nice exchange. I liked that he didn't give me a lot of worksheets because those suck! I preferred writing essays to him - the things I was figuring out, the things I was trying to resolve, and the things that surprisingly became crystal clear to me. He's really a nerd because he read them. lol

I asked him if it is really necessary to be "diagnosed". I don't quite remember what he exactly said but he said something along the lines of how I said it [here](https://uzzielperez.github.io/life/2019/12/08/On-being-self-aware.html). "I think what matters more if there are traits that could be insidious and particular emotions that need to be regulated. Then we work on those particular symptoms and their underlying causes. And I do not think the underlying causes are the labels."

And in typical "aspie" fashion he said the reason they exist is that people are making a lot of money out of them. :P (But am still curious if the Human Connectome Project will help reveal more insights about the physiological difference between a "normal" brain and those people on the spectrum).

Yesterday was my last session with him for technical reasons. I felt sad.... emotional. We ended early, 15 minutes before the hour because I left my laptop charger. But then after we ended I found a spare in my office. All I could think was, I wish I had found that cord and so we could have had more time....

It feels like a [loss](https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/08/23/david-eagleman-livewired-drug-withdrawal-heartbreak/) when someone who had helped positively shape you somehow no longer becomes a regular part of your life. But that is life and I feel like that gorilla baby that's just been released back to the wild.
