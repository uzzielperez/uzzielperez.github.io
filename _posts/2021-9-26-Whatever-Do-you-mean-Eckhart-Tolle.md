In the past two weeks, I must have interacted and had talks with over 20 people over a project that I am working on. I felt that my mind has opened up in a way.
Talking to people has a psychedelic effect. No, I don't mean acid trips where you see weird shape and colors. What I mean is that it opened up my mind to possibilities, ways of getting to a destination or building a passion project or dream that I've never thought was possible. So there is probably some sense in saying that "[Isolation is the dream killer](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=isolation+is+the+dream+killer)".

-----------------

The uber social past 2-3 weeks culminated in me bringing my college best friend, Je, back to the airport. This prompted me to write a bit. Writing clarifies my thoughts and I believe is also another form of connecting with the people I love and care about. Since I am physically apart from my best friends, this is a good way for me "imagine how it feels like to connect with them". And perhaps when my physical body is no longer here, perhaps some folks would find comfort in my thoughts or in what I say. Although this is me mostly talking, I try to balance things out by hearing other people's thoughts through books, podcasts and trying to have some time to interact with "real" people. There are only a few people in this world who would hear me "blab" in real life. If I could tell stories with them, it means I am comfortable haha.

------------------

I do know though that neurobiologically, some "brains" are wired in such a way that they are very sensitive to inputs from the environment that their brain cells get fatigued quite quickly. This means they require a lot of isolation. Ok, we can call them "[introverts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0KYU2j0TM4)". Personally, I find myself more introverted although I have trained myself to be a little more extraverted, i.e. being able to read social cues, and wanting to connect.

-----------------

While our current culture and society rewards extraversion more than introversion, [Susan Cain argues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0KYU2j0TM4) that we should also leave a lot of space for introverts to spend some time alone. I believe so too. Our ability to step back and rethink "group think" drives innovation and creativity.

------------------

I told my best friend that I am practicing this thing where if I feel like I have a "maladaptive and imbalanced trait", I would have to try to do the opposite of what I "automatically do". By maladaptive, I mean, a trait that no longer serves me at this time of my life. For instance, my best friend and I are *highly deferential* and *people-pleasing*. But we knew that we have to learn how to be a little more assertive and practice being able to say our needs and wants rather than keeping them inside and letting resentment build. Took me a while practicing this. It felt so *unnatural*, but I feel like my personal and professional relationships, and even my relationship with myself are better than before.

------------------

Practice. Rewiring. They say it takes 21 days to build a habit. I haven't really experimented on it. But I use it as a rule of thumb whenever I want to build a good habit or let go of a bad one. The thing with building a good habit, for example "Working out" or "Meditating" is that they are not easy at first. I wrote about this in the past in this [post](https://uzzielperez.github.io/life,/pleasant/thoughts/series/2020/07/02/Chamonix-MontBlanc3.html).

-------------------

**Long-term potentiation.** **Altering Traits.** I've read from several sources (I don't even remember where), that the "highs, calmness, clarity and enlightenment" that intermediate level meditators feel fade away after a relatively short while. For example, if a New Yorker who went on a meditation retreat in Bali or some Buddhist monastery in the Catskill Mountains would return back to their hectic city life, they would soon return to their harried ways, having a sense that their life is not their own, and their internal emotions easily perturbed in the presence of some level of external turmoil. Olympic meditators on the other hand, have a sense of equanimity in the face of life storms.

It made me think, perhaps if I could take this meditation thing seriously, I would feel a change in myself. That I wouldn't be "so reactive" as I was before. It's been more than a year now. I still feel like I get hurt, perturbed, disappointed and sad. But I also have built some kind of internal resource to get back up whenever I feel like life had tripped me and I found my face falling back to the ground. But if I have my menstrual period, I'm still kinda nuts. hehe.

-------------------

When I have my period, I feel like my RA and my brain are both acting up. I tried to read a little bit about hormonal effects on inflammation. I haven't built a good understanding yet. But I found that listening to "theta and gamma waves" tunes the "orchestra in my brain" to a more calm state. It is an experiment that is not robust and probably just works for me, where confirmation bias and placebo have not been ruled out. I need to collect more data. Those "waves" linger in [Olympic meditator brains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10J6crRacZg) for a while longer than just amateur level meditators.

It made me feel hopeful. Beyond the cognitive and practical health benefits of meditation, I found that it helps me, first and foremost, find trust and safety within myself. I want to continue deeper into it.

-------------------

I've heard of people with substance dependence issues regain control of their impulses through meditation. I once heard a Doctor who specializes in addiction and recovery prescribe "mindfulness". I tried it on myself. Specially with Coke and my compulsive "Ferrero Rocher" eating during lockdowns last year. The idea was to carefully observe the after effects of the consumption on your physical and mental state. Too much sweets make me crash mentally and physically. Typical sugar crash. I also used this to gradually transition to vegetarianism. I occasionally still eat salmon but I have lost appetite for burger. Another thing I compulsively ate in the past. I found eating meat and bread makes my inflammation worse.

-------------------

Pecier (my second longest best friend after Je) wrote something about "self-control" [here](https://manilastandard.net/opinion/columns/sounds-of-science/284083/the-science-of-self-control.html). He argues it's not about "discipline".

-------------------

**The vehicle is not ready.** Eckhart Tolle has a lot of [New Age mumbo jumbo shit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8XPVclekrQ). But like the "people pleaser" that I am, I try to listen and understand. Or perhaps there is also a genuine desire to understand a point-of-view that I don't necessarily see in the scientific world. In this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8XPVclekrQ), he talks about his observation of great penalty takers, who "breathe" and "pause" before kicking. But he says that even if he is practiced in the art of pausing and breathing, he won't necessarily be able to put the ball at the back of the net because the "vehicle is not prepared" for kicking the ball. Ha!

I have heard of some explanations from a [Standford neuroscientist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hniIopesFSg) on the effect of
breath control in inducing a state of calm. **Nerd explanation alert!** Breathing is something you could consciously control and train over time. This could [override some of the functions of some neurons in one's amygdala](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/breath). Effectively, having some level of control over your 'autonomic nervous system' [(sumpaper)[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4034215/], (anuder)[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053811918300673]].

---------------------

Now the thing with medical research is that there are a lot of contradicting claims and studies. So how does one know what actually works? Is the way we're doing science still the right way to go when it comes to bodies that are not "normal"?

---------------------

Final blab of the night. On the way back to Geneva from France, border police went and checked for passports. It's the first time that I've been checked on a train and only had my Legitimation card. I had to explain myself that I usually don't get checked for passports and so I wasn't so mindful about bringing it. He let me go but the experience perturbed me for a few minutes even if the police man was respecftful and understanding. On a "rational" level I told myself that "It was a small thing", but it already had set me off a little bit "physiologically". Something that takes a few minutes to "stabilize".

Here is where CBT thought replacement's limitation lies. For complex trauma patients, mere thought replacement doesn't bring about a calmness and sense of safety in their physiological states. A good resource - [The Body Keeps the Score](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSCXyYuT2rE). A related song - [Blue Sky Mind - In and Through the Body](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1HMiuv4QFY).

This perturbation feels like "I need more practice". If you know what I mean.

---------------------

Anyway, I've been spending a lot of time listening to a lot of inputs recently that I want to spend some time determining what works for me and the direction I want to take for the project. I hope I never lose sight of why I am doing this in the first place. It helps to write.

---------------------

I had some extra energy to write for a bit. :) Good night.
