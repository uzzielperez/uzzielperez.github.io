*What are the things that make you feel alive?*

I had some interesting conversations with some folks this week about the idea of satisfaction and happiness. I've been reading parts of Michelle Obama's book, "Becoming" and found it quite grounding that she wasn't the only one who had questioned whether there is any meaning to what she was doing as a lawyer. She was an achiever, aced all the exams of her life but she had failed the bar the first time she took it. She was already dating Barack Obama at this time. She had described her first admission for a lack of meaning and joy in her work as "self-indulgent". Her lawyerly work pays well. But it didn't give her joy.

A lawyer friend had told me that in their circle, burn out is indeed a common thing. I had naively mentioned "that for people like you, you must have this inner fortitude to *finish things* and not drop things on a whim, in the way that you have gone through all the academic hoops to get to that high paying job that you have".  I was weirdly surprised and not surprised by her response. It's not about them being "strong". Turns out the common joke among them is that all of them could just one day *rage quit* their jobs, buy a one-way ticket to Bali, and become a Yoga instructor! Ha! So, we are all humans. The improvement of our material conditions could only make us happy by a certain amount.

The thing with dissatisfaction is that it will always be there. You get to live in your dream country, you get your dream work but you wish you had this or that. There would always be something to complain about. Truly, I am much happier now than I was when I didn't have to worry about money, where to live, when I'd eat next or whether I'd be able to study for my exam tomorrow (because we couldn't pay the electricity bills on-time). But somehow, there is still something lacking. There would always be a mismatch between reality and what you wish you have right now. Although, if you play or have played your card rights, you can close that gap over time.

Despite law being cold, I could still see the joy in my friend's eyes as she describes the work that she has done and the interesting competitions she had joined in! And living in a place where work-life balance is much more valued than bigger cities like Paris or London, this seems like a joyful place to live. I agree with her too since we are both not from here. But despite the beauty in here and the material wealth, Switzerland has one of the highest suicide rates in the world and not all locals appreciate this place. Perhaps, from the lack of novelty from living here all their lives. Swans don't surprise them as much as they fascinate me. Mountains don't inspire them as much as they lift me.

If people's problems in here are more tangible, more identifiable, like "where would I get my money to eat?", the solution seems clearer. But if the problem is existential... where do we even begin?

One of the last things we talked about was how that there seem to be some folks who just find satisfaction and happiness in the doing. That they just seem "happy" and not questioning if any of their work was necessary or makes sense. I wondered "is there anything that could crush these people's spirits?". Some people must be hardwired to be happier folks than others I guess.

I've been feeling almost too serene that it is what you call "boring". As much as I dislike drama (Disclaimer: We probably have different definitions. My definition of drama is unecessarily getting swept away by feelings of anger or emotions that are counterproductive or self-sabotaging), I do like to feel euphoria! I just don't like the crash that comes after. I think I've figured out a bunch of things about trying to feel good "in the moment" and producing my natural anti-depressants. But I can understand how, sometimes natural things aren't enough. Some people probably need drugs or alcohol just to "feel good". Some people need the thrill of romance or the thrill of the chase to feel alive. Some people find euphoria in nature or in high-adrenaline sports. All of us need that "HIT" or "OOMPH" to feel something - which is sometimes something that is out of our control. Some of them create dependence, and that is what I want to avoid. Because when that happens, the feeling of "agency" and "autonomy" disappears. We are left powerless.

And so here I begin an intentional *Joie de Vivre* project - carefully making observations about finding joy in life, in our relationships, in our hobbies, in aesthetics, in our work, in the little things, in finding life's meaning. Perhaps doing some little experiments on myself, and my reactions would help me learn about myself more. And I wanted to really make the last few laps of this PhD to be enjoyable and satisfying, instead of dreadful. I don't want to feel so hopeless that I just need to drag myself to the finish line. I want to be able to *own my actions* despite the contstraints and perhaps mold the context in as much as I can to support the last few months of my work here. Let us see what this *process of learning* brings.

P.s. If you are grieving and do not find any joy in life at all, please do ask for help. I've learned the hard way, that it's ok to be sad for a while until you decide that *fASD this*, I'm done being sad. (Some brain bugs delete my old versions)
