**"Diversified enough to survive, concentrated enough to matter"** - [James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/august-26-2021)

Nothing much for this weekend because I'm tired and need deep rest.

* Excitement and Predictability
* Safety and Growth
* Comfort and Pushing your Limits

We need both.

* Deep Rest. Deep Work.
* Intentionality and Flow.
* Comfort and Challenge

There's a difference between "pushing yourself to the limit" and "pushing yourself past your limit".
Knowing your limit is part of knowing yourself.
Expanding or scaling down your limit is part of 'creating yourself'.

Knowing and creating oneself. There's a rhythm to it.

Just a short set of notes that I want to share.
I've a long day tomorrow.
I just feel super relaxed and sleepy now after a swim in the lake.

Sometimes we need to relax in such a way that we give the "time-travelling, introspection" networks of our brain all the energy it needs. The kind of thing where we could comfortably pause, take a step back and say 'wait a minute, there must be a more clever way to do this.'

And then, there must be days where we give all our energies to the task-oriented networks when we've figured it out, or even when we haven't figured things out. In fact, specially when you haven't figured things out and have stayed too long in that state.

Both brain networks matter.

* Exteriorize. Interiorize.
* Zoom in. Zoom out.

Good night.
