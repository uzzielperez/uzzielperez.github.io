“Parkinson's patients are the experts on what we have. We have a responsibility as patients to share our experience — what works for us, what we respond to, what we can contribute to research.”

— Michael J. Fox

Probably still sloppy writing but I just want to write!

I met a nice doctor who knows some folks who does research on the origins of fibromyalgia. If you don't know already, fibromyalgia is characterized by pain, muscle aches and fatigue quite similar to other autoimmune illnesses.
He said that doctors typically find it hard to pin down what is causing such a systemic, whole body disorder. And this is also common in women. I'm not yet prepared to discuss in detail what he told me exactly as I am still processing myself what I'm learning in this understudied area of research.
But if you are interested and are curious like me and want to connect the dots and be empowered, I do suggest reading the book "The Body Keeps Score" and "Everything I have is yours" by Eleanor Henderson. Although, in the latter book the affected one is the husband.

I especially liked him because he was humble and that he said that what he supplemented what he learned in medical school by doing research. And he even said that he couldn't keep track of all the new things that are coming out.

I had a room mate who was very kind but someone you would say quite "touchy". I didn't really seem to mind it at that time. One time she came home and she had lost her memory. Someone she loved had shouted at her on the phone. I initially thought she had a stroke after she walked outside in the heat of summer. She came home like she was Dory. "Where am I? Where did I come from? Why am I dressed up?" I kept answering her questions every 2 minutes. I wanted to make a bot to answer her. I knew I couldn't handle it myself so I called back her best friend who was funny as hell made her laugh. Her memory had slowly returned. I figured laughter made her relax.

When her best friend left, she was then back to deal with her thoughts. I tried to watch over her as she tried to sleep. Noticing that she was not breathing well and that her blood pressure was too high, I brought her to the ER at midnight. At the ER they confirmed her blood pressure was over the roof and they ordered an fMRI on her brain. There they confirmed what I had suspected - "transient global amnesia". Thankfully, she was ok and she just needed to regulate physiologically and emotionally.

But what makes someone more "touchy" than others or seem to react, in our views "disproportionately" to something? Bessel Van Der Kolk's book has some interesting insights. (Not a paid promotion)

I wonder to myself whether physiological stress affects how we fall back into thought loops or feeling like we are in a rut. What if we could open pathways in the brain that will get us out of the thought loops? Eastern Medicine has long had answers to this but they are relegated to non-standard treatments and unfortunately outside of the realm of evidence-based medicine (EBM) by people who "believe in science" (like I do). But I know they are effective over the long run if they are "practiced". I know I've, unfortunately, fallen out of the "practice" since I have a record of my habits. And then of course, there are non-standard treatments like psychedelics which help with an overactive default mode network [3].

 If we knew how to regulate our physiology we could also regulate our mind and vice-versa. This leads me to once again question the reliability of DSM. There are many psychiatric disorders or "labels" that are unhelpful. I have heard of someone who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder who had an endocrine system issue. Adele herself said that when she had removed gluten in her diet that had helped alleviate her depression. Often times, our standard treatment is through giving complex cocktails of medications that might just be masking the symptoms but are not solving the underlying issues - like lack of nutrition, early childhood adversity, or some genetic disorder that is mild.

However, I must say that I am in favor of a combination of pharmacological solutions for some time to deal with the peak of the crisis and then gradually control with a robust behavioural protocol. I highly suggest reading the Briggs Protocol [1,2] which was devised by a Physicist who had suffered from ulcerative colitis for so long.

In the middle of summer this year I thought to myself "patients are experts too..." And it warms my heart to know that this isn't just a form of arrogance but something that other patients that have lived with some illnesses for so long know inside of themselves too.
