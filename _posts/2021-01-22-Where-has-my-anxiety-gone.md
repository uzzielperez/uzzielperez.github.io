*When was the last time you felt that your life was truly in danger?*

I joined a self-rescue mask training last Monday. It was a training on how to put on a mask that will give you oxygen for 30 minutes in case
there was an accident in the LHC tunnel. The goal for this training was to be able to put on the mask in proper sequence within 40 seconds (or else you could die)!
Before COVID-19, the training was done in a simulation tunnel complete with the alarm sounds, and the red lights turning on and off, and a smoke machine! You'd have to be able to put the mask
on within 40 seconds with all those realistic conditions and in the dark!

Before the training, I went to see my psychologist/psychiatrist to discuss my progress. I was feeling quite ok for the past month or so. I'd been quite consistent on the "presence over productivity" practice, the exercising and the daily (longer) meditations. I felt I was doing something right physiologicallyapart from having better thought quality. I was feeling so fine that I'm getting a little nervous sometimes about where my constant monkey friend had gone to. He told me then it means you're probably no longer feeling it for the wrong reasons or it's good you're not feeling it even when objectively there's no danger. The following day I realized I had lost my credit card (ack), had to move to a new place, figure out how to get money, figure out how to get to Self-rescue mask course. I have been practicing taking good care of myself but it felt impossible to turn-off the problem-solving mind for about 4 days. And when I've solved the problems, essentially removed the stressors, the effect on the body still lingers. The phenomenon is amazing. How getting rid of the stressor is a separate step from taking care of the physiological after effects.

I failed the first test of the self-rescue mask training and then passed the 2nd one. I did try to calm myself down through breathing. But I figured I'd want to rehearse the steps on my own imagining the actual conditions where it could happen. Otherwise, I could really die. This reminded me of several things. One, how I prepared for the qualifying exams. I'd say I was (and probably still am) an "overpreparer". I have had a long history with test anxiety and it was probably associated with perfectionism, not wanting to fail and actually losing my scholarship. In this case, for the PhD qualifiers, I had one more chance to pass the Electromagnetism exam. The first one I was underprepared and failed. If I fail again, the consequence was I lose my visa status and I'd have to go home (or find another program which costs a lot of money). To prepare, I answered every practice question from the physics practice tests and simulated timed conditions just to prepare me mentally. Two hours in the morning. Two hours in the afternoon. I was very methodical and I tried to be very disciplined. And then I also tried to answer a lot of new questions from a text book to become more "agile" just in case I would encounter a question I didn't see before in the actual exam. In that case, I tried to train myself to not panic and be clear-headed so I can deconstruct the questions and get a few points. If I'm lucky, I'll figure out everything in time and get maximum points. Second, when Obama was preparing for the Presidential debates his team even had him train in a replica of the debate stage! That apparently made a lot of difference in his performance, he said! And it was nice to hear his process of not just preparing for every possible question that was going to be thrown at him but also psyching himself up. He went to the gym, played basketball and also listened to music. He highlighted in his biography, Eminem's song "You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime ". These were just two examples where the value of preparation is extremely important specially when the stakes are high.

Stress is not necessarily a bad thing. It allows us to perform, to "rise up to the occasion" as the Nagoski sisters said. It is chronic stress that's not good. The one that gets stuck in your body. And for some weird brains like mine, it can stay for a while and hijack my entire body. Can't just turn it off with "Keep calm. There's nothing to worry about. And everything's done now." I really need to do something physical like running, yoga plus just some plain old resting to relax. And I no longer code when I'm super stressed. Because 1.) I make more mistakes when I'm not clear-headed, relaxed and present. 2.) I don't want to associate coding with too much stress. I feel more effective this way, being "present".

But right now, after a week, my amygdala is still "mostly" on fire. Thankful for the few windows of calmness. I'm hoping I could get quiet it down the next few days so I can get back to the rhythm I want to do physics. :P And maybe one day, I'd really like to go own those nature trips with extreme conditions. :)

In case the natural route doesn't work, e.g. physical exercise, meditation, or yoga aren't enough to regulate your stress response even in the absence of any "objective" danger, I think it is best to ask for help. In my case, when it has gone too long for me, (even embarrassingly shy to admit to myself but shouldn't), I need pharmacological intervention.
