I had carried a little notebook with me throughout the trip in Chamonix. It was always within my reach at all times during my 3-day stay in the little town. Every time some thought came I would write it down. As they say, *the fadest ink is more powerful than the strongest memory*.

One of the things I wrote is the idea of going with the flow. With the many things happening in the world, there are things that we have to fight and not take sitting down. We can't just let them be, I believe. But I had to remind myself that the personal domain is different. There are many things that are better left on their own. They have their own time. We just have to let things unfold.

There is this classic story of a farmer who had a horse he loved so much. For some weird reason, it ran away and a nosey neighbor offered his condolences and told him "That's so unfortunate! This is terrible for you. You won't be able to till the land and live!" The farmer replied: "Maybe. Could be good. Could be bad. We shall see."

The next day, the farmer's son had broken his leg. One of the horses threw him to the ground. The same nosey neighbor said "What a tragedy! Your son won't be able to help with the land. You must be devastated!". Again, the farmer replied: "Maybe. Could be good. Could be bad. We shall see."

The farmer experiences a series of unfortunate events. Each time he responds in the same way.

There are many [versions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3P7f0Zg9wk) of [this](https://mydepressionzone.com/depression-fighter/the-story-of-the-zen-farmer/) story. But it reminds me of the thoughts and feelings that came to me when I was just sitting still on the boulder on the mountains. The world is uncertain and we have to learn how to accept that reality. 

I know this is just a simple story and parable but it's all connected to the things I've been thinking about in the mountains. Life is random and it is difficult to tell on an individual level where we'll end up. It is good to have goals, dreams and plans but at most, they only make the "random walk" a "weighted random walk". Whenever I forget this reality, it only makes me worry more. Life is just like that. And if you think about, it is what makes life fun, exciting and interesting to live!

I had not known about this farmer story until today. But I felt "We'll see" was very zen... I have a few more things connected to these thoughts that I want to write down for myself, connected to "flow", repetition, intuition and cognitive ease. These are non-generalizable ideas. And I will only talk about repeatable successes for myself.

For now, I am very happy that I am functional at work again. And I will work at this consistently comfortable pace for now.
