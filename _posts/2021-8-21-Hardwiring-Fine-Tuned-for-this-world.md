*Between stimulus and response, there is a space. -Alan Watts*

The other day I spent several hours following a manual to do some testing and the reassembly of a piece of object for the detector.
It was my first time doing it and hadn't it been for the presence of people who've spent for time on it than me, I would've taken even ages to do the task.
I didn't finish it in the end because I couldn't find some parts and it was already 8 pm. It was getting dark and the last shuttle back to civilization left more than an hour ago.
So I walked back home. I enjoy long-distance walking, unless my joints hurt.

I wish I had finished it. There was a mix of frustration of - I am not as "efficient" as I used to be. And I made some mistakes too. But I knew it wasn't for a lack of "willpower" or "trying to do one's best". It was a physical thing. I consoled myself by saying - "if I did it enough times, I'd be more efficient on this task. I'll know where to find the tools, I'll know which parts go where without looking at the manual. I'll know which buttons to switch on like it was second nature."

That was an aside. Today, I wanted to talk about uncontrollable things, like compulsions and "default behaviours". You know, like the kind of thing that tells you I-totally-have-very-little- control-over-this-in-the-moment kind of thing! Like a fit of frustration, or anger, or sadness that overpowers a person. I say in the moment because, on some days you would've *reacted differently*. What makes for the difference?

I had several compulsions that day. One, I had a strong wanting to eat chips and drink coca cola - cheap junk food, easy to acquire, a "default" for my fatigued and tired mind. Hadn't it been for my flare ups, the inner voice "they'll make you feel TERRIBLE after" I would've bought them immediately. But since I walked back home, (I love walking) I had that "space" to change my response. Once I got to the convenience store, I looked at the selection of refreshing drinks. Coca Cola ZERO. Yummmm! I can hear the sound of the pop and fizzing of the coke when I open the cap. And I could feel the sensation of the fizzy drink traversing my tongue.... and STOP... I turned my gaze towards the Volvic mint tea instead. There's a bit of sugar but it's a good replacement. Satisfying. Less hurtful for my gut. And I had replaced the chips with some sushi (which I belatedly realize was a mistake because I can't even take high carbs now with my flare ups). I felt a little "proud" of myself as I sat on the tram back home. "Good doggie!"

------------------------------------------------
When we are *spent*, we have very little mental bandwidth to think about things and we default to our old habits and old thinking patterns. I'm not saying that everything "default" is bad.
In fact, some default serves to protect us. For example, "FEAR" can stop us from doing dumb things that could kill us or accidentally hurt another person. Like we "normally" wouldn't jump into a volcano because of fear. Or swim in a river that we had very little knowledge of. There might be Pirrhannas there or the current might be too strong. (That's why I agree that sometimes the "antidote to fear" is knowledge. If we knew more about the river then we know that it's relatively safe to swim there. And there are protocols in place in case you or someone else is in danger, or how to avoid that danger in the first place. Or sometimes "knowledge" recalibrates our "FEAR" response too. For example, my habitual coca cola drinking has been upsetting my stomach and was actually ruining the way my brain worked.

------------------------------------------------

All of this reminded me of the study on Decision fatigue and Israeli judges. I'm quoting this [article](https://blogs.jwatch.org/frontlines-clinical-medicine/2016/10/19/fighting-decision-fatigue/)

"Researchers found that judges were far more likely to issue favorable decisions to prisoners seeking parole if the cases were heard early in the day. The likelihood of a favorable judgment declined with each subsequent case but improved after a break for food or rest. It seemed that for those seeking mercy from the court, timing was everything."

So it seems that the "Badness" of decisions could be a function of how much "mental reserve", or I always like to call it "bandwidth" people have left.

But what about if you're starting to feel like you're making bad choices all the time? I remember that prior to my flares, I had a series of misfortunes that led me back to my old coping mechanisms. If it wasn't for a "pause" week with Kitty Cats and Doggie in Crozet, I wouldn't have stopped the spiral. I can imagine how harder it is for former alcoholics and drug dependents to fight against their compulsions. Other forms of compulsions exist - spending sprees that max out credit cards, not being able to stop enabling and codependent patterns in relationships, being irritable and grumpy towards people, and for a Tarsier in deep distress "letting go of the tree branch to die" because these tourists won't stop taking pictures of their big cute eyes!

--------------------------------------------------
I remember vividly a day when my professor in Liberation Theology asked our class "Should we punish juvenile delinquents who steal and sniff solvents?". They sniff solvents to fight hunger. I don't quite remember what exactly was said, but I remember that I answered him in front of a big class. My voice cracked and I started to tear up. He said what the kids were doing were "wrong" and that they should be "corrected". Back then, I didn't yet have the vocabulary to explain my argument very well. All I knew is that I understood why they did those things, even if in our eyes, they were "wrong". It's very easy to sit inside an air-conditioned classroom filled with rich kids who could afford a good lunch. They're children of politicians, business tycoons, from all over the Philippines. There were a few of us scholars. There's this judgment that "poor" people don't work hard enough or make bad choices - like have too many kids, spending beyond their means, in general making bad choices. Just like what "Utopia for Realists says" - it could be that *Poor people are poor because they make bad choices* *Maybe they make bad choices because they're poor*. Some people have never felt the physical sensation of the constant distress, anxiety, or in some cases completely "not caring" in the presence of life stressors. And somehow the constancy of these stressors from one's youth almost hard codes young brains into a lifetime of having the same stress response and coping mechanisms.

I don't disagree that the "stealing" and "sniffing solvents" shouldn't be, for a lack of a better term, "corrected". I just think that while punishments are very efficient to "seemingly solve" things - i.e. they're great deterrents, they instill fear to not do these things. But they don't solve the issues on why they engage in these behaviors in the first place. Think of drug addicts, alcoholics, codependents (I will use this term in a non-nuanced, clinical psych sense). Even if they already have the knowledge that their behaviours are self-sabotaging, i.e. could ruin their life and dreams, the "here and now" is all that their minds can take.

----------------------------------------------------
My writing time is up. I think this is a good jumping point for the next few things I wanted to talk about. How could we change our responses if the "compulsion" is strong? When is it safe to change the response when it feels like your life depends on it or when there is so much distress and pain? How can we have willpower? Is it even about willpower? How do we deal with a general lack of motivation? Is laziness an unmodifiable character trait? Is compulsive laziness actually useful? How could we manage our money better? Why do addicts (of different forms) still do what they do despite the consequences? How does consciousness help with changing our responses?

------------------------------------------

I'll be sharing a bunch of stuff I've learned from "Tinker, Dabble, Doodle, Try: Unlock the Power of the Unfocused Mind", "Rewiring the Addicted Brain" and "What's Wrong with my Brain". They were quite helpful for me the last few months. And so was learning from Tim Ferriss, Cal Newport, James Clear, Debbie Millman and a secret person I won't reveal until the next post *wink!*.  All of them taught me the following:
1.) Instead of just having goals, we should have systems. (For those who are anti-systems, give this a chance. It's interesting and has room for both freedom and constraining.)
2.) Why prescriptions and mental models should be challenged. When do we know they're just to be "updated" or need to be "destroyed"? And if we destroy them, will it destroy us? You'll know what I mean later.

This time I have an update on my understanding of Alan Watts's "presence over productivity" principle too.

P.S. Between stimulus and response, there is a space. Unless maybe if you're a plant? Interestingly, plants do change their responses too! If you're interested listen to my favorite podcast on [Smarty Plants](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/smarty-plants) from Radiolab.
