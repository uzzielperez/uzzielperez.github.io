*Photon Isolation*. It was a concept I took for granted. My adviser asked me something along the lines of why do we care about isolation when it comes to generators? And my immediate answer was, "Omg, I don't know!" I thought it was simply a detector issue where we classify "Photon" vs "Not Photon" based on how isolated it is from a spray of other particles. That is, if we looked at the detector information, look at the central that got hit by the photon and the surrounding crystals hit by the spray, we could tell how unisolated it is by how much the surrounding crystals "light up".

I committed myself to go on these relaxed reading sessions, so I actually enjoy them. And then get an idea of what Photon isolation meant in the context of calculating cross-sections. This is important when we want to make a prediction based on a theory/model and then see how well the prediction matches up with reality - i.e. the experimental measurement.

This is just my first round of reading but the first key take-away is that there is no "clean line" between what is an isolated and a non-isolated photon. How one defines isolation, affects the predicted cross-section.

Another important thing to take note of when it comes to experimental outcomes and predictions involving photons - Photons are produced in two ways. First, they could either be produced through a hard collision which could be dealt which is computable with perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD). Second, they could be produced by a messier fragmentation process, for example a quark or gluon fragmenting into a photon. If I understand this correctly, in the generator level, there is an added complication in the pQCD calculation involving prompt photons. Because, again, there is no "sharp, distinct" line between the photons and the partons.

I'll talk more about this and the types of isolation in the coming weeks as we determine what type we'll use for our analysis. For now, I recommend this [paper by Frixione](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9801442v1).
