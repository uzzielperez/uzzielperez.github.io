Now that I've had an initial idea of what the selection efficiency, i.e., how well we're letting in "real" photons, it's now time to turn our attention to how much fakes we're letting in.

In doing analyses, it is important that we try to know the main differences among the different physics objects we are looking at. In my work, I look at photons as part of my signal and I have jets and electrons that contained in the background since they could fake the photons in the detector. Btw, jets are a "spray" of particles that come out of a process called "hadronization". In this process, hadrons which are composite particles made up of *quarks* are formed. This process comes about because we can't see color-charged particles such as quarks and gluons in isolation. When you pull apart these quarks and gluons from one another, the strong force acts like a strange rubber band that pulls them back together. The farther they are from one another the stronger the strong force. The energy is so strong that new particles pop out (of the vacuum?), hence the spray of extra particles that we can detect. Asymptotic freedom is pretty cool. (I found this to be a good read from Frank Wilczek - *[Asymptotic Freedom: From Paradox to Paradigm](z48gntbbu9pl.com)*

Experimental physicists have created variables that highlight the main differences between these three. In broad strokes, photon signals are quite clean. They are neutral, they don't go very far into the detector and they don't quite create a big "splash" (in what is called the "eta-phi" space). Since they are neutral, they don't leave a track in the "tracker system". They don't go very deep, i.e. most of their energies are contained in "Electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL)". Electrons are similar except they leave a track since they're charged. Jets are a lot messier, has a bigger "splash" and also goes deeper and deposits more energy past the HCAL. Knowing those differences you can design your selection ID which could be a set of "cuts" or thresholds on the relevant variables.

Now we have to ask, is the selection ID we have throwing away as much background while minimizing signal loss. We have to have a way to quantify the electron-photon misidentification or the jet-photon misidentification rates. To do this, we use what is called the "fake rate". To put it simply it's the ratio of the number of the number of jets/electrons passing the photon selection ID we're using and the number that passes a *tweaked and looser* version of it.

There's a caveat though, the numerator would also let in "real photons" and we'd have to remove them. To do this we'd have to a fitting procedure where template model of fake and real photons are fit to the data in the control sample we're looking at. To make things a little more concrete, we could pick a variable called $\sigma_{i\eta i\eta}$ which describes how big the "splash" of the objects are. This is quite sensitive to the difference between the fake and real photons.

Real templates could be obtained from a photon-rich simulated sample that is produced from an MC calculator. Fake templates, on the other hand, are derived from a jet-enriched dataset. They are both normalized to 1 $fb^{-1}$. We then perform a fit using a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). I will discuss more about this in a later blog post. (But as a minimum, you want to find a distribution that could "probabilistically describe" your how much of your data is populated with fakes. As far as I understand it.)

## A different Fake Rate Method

Admittedly, this post has been sitting for several days so by midweek, my adviser and I discussed a different strategy to determine the fake rate. Instead of determining the numerator and the denominator, we've decided to go straight to the "template fitting method". That technical term is kind of useless right now, and does not communicate clearly what it exactly is so I'm going to break that method into pieces.

The idea is, we're going to have to look at the data after some time. We're going to do a "blind analysis" first using a monte carlo simulation that best represents the data. We need to prepare "templates" or distributions that describe a variety of events consisting of a combination of electrons, jets, and photons. You can try to imagine what those combinations are, if let's say we're looking for a particular pair of objects. So each of those would have some shape or distribution that we could compare against the data. Note that we'd also have to figure out a way to extract these templates from data so we can "avoid biases coming from the imperfect modeling of the events in simulation" (see [ref on diphoton production measurement](http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7225)).

My adviser drew a picture for me that I think made what I need to do to get started somewhat clearer. In principle, the data should be a sum of the "real signal contribution" and all the other "fake templates". In this case, we consider only one fake. If we use $\sigma_{i\etai\eta}$ as the discriminating variable, i.e. we plot the distributions of the data, the real template and the fake template and superimpose them against one another, we'll see something interesting. The fakes have a rather wider distribution, meaning a bigger "splash". This is the big picture understanding for now and things will get a little clearer in my head as I go into more detailed work.

When we're done with the fake rate estimation will then have to subtract the fake from the data instead of doing some kind of "reweighting".
