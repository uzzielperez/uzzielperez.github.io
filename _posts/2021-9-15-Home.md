I'd like start thinking about planting my roots already after this PhD (or if a great opportunity comes, I might have to just finish the Thesis at the side). I already know I'm not going to continue in Physics, but I'm going to continue doing science.

Also, trying to make better life choices aimed at an adventurous life, filled with curiosity, laughter and connection.
I kinda like [Thich Nhat Hanh's](https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/03/31/how-to-love-thich-nhat-hanh/) thoughts on the "Art of Interbeing".

I think I understand my brain a lot better now too. I was going to write and draw about the different brain parts but it's too nerdy and it feels like we're reducing everything to a map.
