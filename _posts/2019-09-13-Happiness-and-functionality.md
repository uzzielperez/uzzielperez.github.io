I'm always wary of the times when I am not able to work. In fact, before, when I found myself relaxing on a weekend, I tend to get worried that I am not working hard enough and would not succeed in life. I got incredibly anxious. There must be a term to that kind of anxiety. I don't know what it is. It is only recently when I learned to just "pause" and recharge. I would do whatever I felt like doing and then I'd work intensely during the work week on 3 to 4-hour time chunks. I do my most cognitively demanding work/projects during those times. And every other task gets done on whatever time's left. I am lucky that my schedule this semester allows me to work in big time chunks.

I'm quite happy with the system so far. It's not perfect yet, as I do find myself spending a few minutes looking at Twitter and other apps. IPhone tells me that those few minutes add up to a little over an hour each day. Maybe up to two hours. I don't plan to completely get off these apps as I do find them a welcome distraction. I find comic relief in them, get "science and society" bits and I also got to meet some amazing people that I would not have met in this rather conservative town.

I am still cultivating my ability to be able sit down with greater focus though. I am getting work done, but not to the point that I would be proud to say that what I produced is a piece of "genius" and is a real contribution to the world or even just to my field. I have a lot of work left to do for myself. But for now, I am quite satisfied that I don't really need to wait for inspiration to strike for me to be able to work on my research. But where do original ideas come from? Certainly not during these intense periods of work, noh?

I have an artist friend whom I really like (yes, I like "like" her and she knows it). I realized she's also a bit nutty, but in a good way. She's obviously fantastic at the work that she does if you check out her portfolio. But like all great artists, she suffers from a bit of anxiety that she's probably lacking a bit of inspiration and currently not able to do work or be "in the flow". Not to mention, she has a lot on her plate. She has responsibilities that make her day fragmented. It's really tough to put this system in place. In previous semesters I suffered the same problem. Last summer I barely got to do research since I had to teach every day. I hate being given unsolicited advice, but I still thought I should share with her something that really helped me just get bits and pieces done, and reach certain project milestones even if it's in a slow and steady pace. I don't know if she'd be comfortable with it (or you the reader would like it) but here it goes...

Cal Newport is a computer scientist from Dartmouth College. He got his PhD from MIT, he's an accomplished researcher with several seminal papers under his name, several books and a successful blog that has been up for over a decade. I've been following his work since college and I would say I wouldn't have graduated with a Physics degree without his advice on practicing "deliberate practice" and "deliberate creativity". One of the simplest and most practical pieces of advice that he gave was to [tally "Deep Work Hours" and milestones](http://www.calnewport.com/blog/2016/12/07/from-deep-tallies-to-deep-schedules-a-recent-change-to-my-deep-work-habits/).

I made my friend listen to the Cal Newport's "Deep Work" audiobook and I had to listen to it again. I am a bit embarrassed that the first hour of the book talks about things are probably not directly applicable to artists. Like being marketable in this days economy. I find that part too "excluding". Not everyone has to participate in the "tech" world. But there are bits in the book that are useful, e.g. cultivating deep work, learning how to learn difficult things, scheduling deep and uninterrupted time chunks to focus on something valuable. It also briefly talks about evidence on how "deep work" helps with myelin growth that helps your neurons fire better. Those are nice pieces.

The exact way how "Deep Work" is practiced by different people is discussed further into the book. Cal shares his own in the later sections. With tallying deep work hours, I don't think Cal means to not sleep and tally as many hours as you can. He himself does not try to work past 5 pm. He claims, he works during the weekdays as intensely as he can and uses the rest of the day/weekend to be fully present to his wife and kids. He also writes his blog when his kids are sleeping and also reads a lot of books.

So, Cal is not saying that you shouldn't relax or that you should clock-in as much time as possible. In fact, it is probably detrimental to one's creativity to not relax.

There's another book called "A Mind for Numbers" that I am reading right now. It's written by Barbara Oakley. I think she captures the essence of what I want to say. Sometimes, the brain needs to "expand" and then be so focused and approach work with a great degree of single-mindedness. She calls these modes "diffuse" and "focused" modes of thinking. The diffuse mode is where we're relaxed and not trying to hard. We simply open are minds to different ideas until our thoughts crystallize into one thing we can confidently zero-in on. That is, I believe where we can deliberately get inspiration.

I think it must be said, "Deliberate Practice/Creativity" and tallying deep work hours gives us better control of our productivity and the whims of our creative mind. It helps us not depend on whether or not inspiration will strike us in order to do work. But like all other pieces of advice, everything must be taken with a grain of salt. You must try honestly and see what works for you.
