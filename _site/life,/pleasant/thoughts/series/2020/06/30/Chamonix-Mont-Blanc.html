<p>Ever since I was a kid, my favorite thing to do to clear my head was either to bike or walk around. On extreme cases, I would ride a jeepney or a bus to travel farther. I would get to Los Baños, Nagcarlan or Dolores (Quezon) and sometimes Manila. I’ve done this since I was 12. I usually had the freedom to do this and not really ask permission. Adults weren’t really around the house. I’d get money from my piggy bank. I’ve always tried to save a little bit of money. (Now that am older am aware that being able to save is a privilege).</p>

<p>The farthest unplanned travel though was getting on a bus from Cubao and landing on the island of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boracay">Boracay</a>. That took 24+ hours. The bus would roll on and roll off in ships and so will we passengers. So the mode of transportation is called RORO.</p>

<p>When the weather isn’t excellent RORO travel makes me sick. The waves are too violent and at night it becomes too cold. One time I didn’t have a jacket. Each time we’d hop off at a port, I’d get really excited because we’d get a respite from the dizzying waves. And the most beautiful thing is, there are no city lights so you’d see the Milky way at some places. Or at least I thought I saw it. :)</p>

<p>Anyway, what I missed most about the Philippines is cheap public transportation and I could get anywhere I wanted to go without having to bug anyone for a ride.</p>

<h3 id="chamonix-mont-blanc">Chamonix-Mont Blanc</h3>

<p>In 2015, I would see a white mountain from the window of my room at Building 38 at CERN. On the other side I would see the Jura mountains which straddles the border of Switzerland and France. The Jurassic period is named after it. It’s always so pleasant to be at the Meyrin site at CERN because of the views.</p>

<p>When I arrived in January, the first thing I did was take photos of them. I took photos of them in the morning when I get out of my room. I take photos at night. And when I moved to Charmilles, I’d go to the areas where’d they’d always be within view. They’re always there. And the pleasant feelings win over everything. :) I wish I could reincarnate as a mountain goat to live there!</p>

<p>It took me 5 more months to be able to get to Chamonix. The borders just reopened and I took the chance. There was no one in the bus and the long lines at the telepherique to Aiguille du Midi were not there. I decided not to climb all the way to the top of Aiguille du Midi because the visibility was poor at the top. I just stopped at Plan de l’Aiguille to hike. After training my legs with shorter hikes, I’m quite happy to see how much progress my leg has made. Still a little wobbly, slow and painful at times. But am pretty impressed myself! And the funnest part was I used some wall climbing techniques to climb the huge boulders whenever I see the hiking tracks suddenly disappear.</p>

<p>I sat down for a bit at the side of Lac Bleu. I took photos of the glaciers and then continued my hike. Six hours in the mountains I’ve decided to take a break again and sit on a huge boulder. I wrote a bit in two little notebooks I had brought with me. I wanted to stay there. I didn’t want to go back to a place that was so noisy. I didn’t want notifications. I didn’t want the internet.</p>

<p>So when I decided to get down, I turned on airplane mode so I won’t pick up wifi signals. I left my bag at my room, walked around Chamonix and read a book at various spots. Chamonix is one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever been to. If you are lucky and the clouds part, Mont Blanc would reveal itself. The sun rays and it’s white majestic glory would tower over the charming little town. I was lucky it did for a few hours while I was walking by the river Arve. This place for me would always be special.</p>

<h3 id="think-simple-the-unplanned-and-what-matters-most">Think Simple, the unplanned and what matters most</h3>

<p>All these trips had one thing in common. They were unplanned and they were the most memorable trips I’ve ever had. They all came at a time when I didn’t really want to think complex things. I just wanted and needed to clear my head and do whatever I felt like doing. My life has so much planning and schedules it’s to once in a while break free.</p>

<p>My therapist told me last Wednesday, “think simple”. I smiled and told him that I can see that my brain has been jumbling a lot of thoughts lately. But I had to go out of the door because he had a new person at 6:30 pm. I had a lot of questions for him. I even wanted to argue with him. I wanted to tell him, “But I’m in the business of complex problems”. I don’t really want your advice, I just need you to listen to me. And I wanted to tell him that “think simple” without any context is a dangerous advice. “Think Simple” is what elected Donald Trump! “Think simple” is letting in implicit biases! “Think simple” is letting go of nuances! “Think simple” means you can’t live with ambiguity, doubt and uncertainty! And the world is nothing but uncertain!</p>

<p>Furthermore, I wanted to tell him these things:</p>

<p>1.) “Simplicity isn’t just a visual style. It’s not just minimalism or the absence of clutter. It involves digging through the depth of the complexity. To be truly simple, you have to go really deep. For example, to have no screws on something, you can end up having a product that is so convoluted and so complex. The better way is to go deeper with the simplicity, to understand everything about it and how it’s manufactured. You have to deeply understand the essence of a product in order to be able to get rid of the parts that are not essential” - <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/how-steve-jobs-love-of-simplicity-fueled-a-design-revolution-23868877/">Jon Ive and Steve Jobs’s Minimalist philosophy</a></p>

<p>2.) And this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkB-kpet3eo">interview</a> with Alain de Botton and founder of the School of Life Series in youtube. He talks about how dissects complex emotional issues. I like this guy because it feels like he’s that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IfvTn7eF0g&amp;t=4s">big brother/sister</a> that will get some sense into your head when you’re heart-broken or troubled.</p>

<p>3.) To be a minimalist, to be simple, you have to go explore the complex and then will you only figure out what is essential to keep. <script type="math/tex">E=mc^2</script>, that simple equation didn’t just simply pop out of the “ether”.</p>

<p>But at the mountains, I had realized something… I had added this extra piece of thought into my therapists’ advice. So it fits in into my mental schema.  <em>“Think simple” is a recognition of the limits of our own minds.”</em> That it is not an infinitely powerful machine capable of holding multiple and seemingly contradicting realities at the same time, ALL THE TIME. I’m a human being. And I am “sick”. I have a diagnosis. If I don’t allow myself to rest from digging into complex things, I can mix things up. I can get sad, I can break and become dysfunctional. That is the worst sign of all. Because even when I am plagued with problems, I do not stop functioning. It is this breaking that instigated these unplanned trips. And in these unplanned trips I recover myself.</p>

<p>(Magnus Carlsen, is also known by his opponents to make annoyingly simple moves in his games. And he also doesn’t train much with computers to memorize variations and complex openings. My guess is that he is aware of how the human mind works. It’s not a database of algorithms and moves. It’s not as powerful as modern-day computers. And he trains himself physically. That helps with pressure and together with deliberate chess training, improves his intuition. This makes him special even if they’re rather simple training methods anyone could do. Am adopting this mental training seriously too.)</p>

<p>I’m a little older now so these episodes happen less frequently and I am quicker to recalibrate and have a more peaceful inner world. I’ve finally told people at work and some friends, hey, “I just had a divorce, there were some medical issues, among other things I don’t need to say here… <em>there is something wrong, I would act a little strange for a while. Could you please let me be a little strange?</em>”.</p>

<p>“Think simple”, at least for me doesn’t mean “think simple” ALL the time. I would still look at complex and interesting problems, take a break - a real break and eventually sort things out. I will write about my progress in the coming days when I feel a little less weird.</p>
