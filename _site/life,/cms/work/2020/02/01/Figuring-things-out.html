    <h1 id="as-a-matter-of-fact">As a matter of fact</h1>

<p>Let me describe the first 2 weeks of my stay at CERN and let me describe it matter-a-factly. I could write this now since I have solved most issues, looking for a place, looking for doctors, finding a way to get money (after Charles Schwab told me my account was not ok because I do not have proof of residence in the US). I was physically in pain during the first week because I think the stress hormones were also on overdrive. I think it’s because I was on problem-solving mode for many days consecutively. My broken leg was swelling from the plane travel and also moving around for arrival formalities and getting my access card. I had my worst day perhaps when I woke up with all my joints swelling - an arthritis flare up! I could tell my body was in shock. And perhaps, I also had some withdrawal from not having friends around. In that case, pharmacological intervention was necessary and I also willed myself to stretch, exercise and meditate again!</p>

<p>The work I needed to do was new too. I wanted to start well. So work plus all the other logistical concerns meant my days were filled to the brim. But I guess I’ve learned to just stop, do some breathing, and force myself to sleep. There’s no point in not resting. I did not want to break. But now that I could sit down some more and relax, I think I’m doing ok now. I tried to deal with many problems, but one problem at a time. And if I couldn’t solve one immediately, I would rest and deal with it a little later.</p>

<p>I’ve watched this TED talk video by Guy Winch again. It’s about handling work-induced anxiety. I think I had that for a bit. He had some practical advice on limiting your work hours and totally shutting down on specified hours. One has to be disciplined about this! He mentioned that work-induced anxiety and the feeling of being overwhelmed could be turned into a more tractable problem. That it could just be turned into a scheduling problem. Initially, I thought “Uhmm, not all tasks can be put in clear time frames”. But I guess, if we can’t do that what we perhaps could do instead is schedule “deep thinking/ deep exploration hours”.</p>

<p>So to sum up what I learned for the past two weeks when dealing with this super duper CRUNCH times is to be disciplined on two ends:</p>

<p>1.) To work and push yourself on concentrating on one problem at a time and exploring it in uninterrupted time blocks.</p>

<p>2.) To stop working, get some sleep. Essentially REST. Force yourself to shut down. There are some types of problems that you can only solve upon waking up. (I was once super curious about this why you can solve things when you are relaxed, and studies on brain waves etc. )</p>

<p>“Gosh, you’re super childish, Uzzie.” This should have been obvious, right? Apparently not! Because I have a weird brain and sometimes it is hard to turn off (or inversely it won’t turn on when it needs to be ON!).</p>

<h1 id="platitudes">Platitudes</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>C’est la vie.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>If you can’t fly then run, if you can’t run then walk, if you can’t walk then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.</strong> – Martin Luther King</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Just keep swimming.</strong> – Dory from Finding Nemo</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was MLK day and I came across an MLK quote that helped me. And then I remember how in my youth, or actually in my early twenties, I thought some people were excessively positive that it was toxic. I now realize that I have a more nuanced view of positivity and positive psychology. And that these sayings are probably more ok than not. People are trying to get by and are finding ways to be able to move forward in life.</p>

<p>A quick google search on the definition of “Platitudes” shows a wikipedia definition:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>A platitude is a trite, meaningless, or prosaic statement, often used as a thought-terminating cliché, aimed at quelling social, emotional, or cognitive unease. Platitudes have been criticized as giving a false impression of wisdom, making it easy to accept falsehoods: A platitude is even worse than a cliché.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It really depends on the circumstance. That’s why I always have salt and spices when travelling. <em>Wink!</em></p>

<p>For fun, here are a <a href="https://scottberkun.com/2011/what-are-the-most-annoying-platitudes/">list of annoying platitudes</a>, some of which are probably very encouraging to me today.</p>

<h1 id="learning-about-a-codebase-and-asking-technical-questions">Learning about a CodeBase and Asking Technical Questions</h1>

<p>I thought also that it is important to document or talk about the idea of learning a new codebase and asking technical questions. For the past two years, I have been developing my own code from scratch using python, and I abhorred working with C++. But since, most of the code infrastructure my team uses for physics analysis, I eventually gave in and adopted the codebase. I initially had a resistance to this idea because first, I thought my creativity, or the way of thinking about solving problems will be severely constrained by the complexity of C++. Python was incredibly simple. Second, when I shift to a well-established code base, I would need to adopt their coding philosophy. In our case, my adviser, strives for completeness and that many physics quantities and information should be stored in the output (called “ntuples”). I wanted to do it another way, which other people in CMS are already doing. They only store simple physics quantities and then you can use your python scripts to calculate more complicated quantities further offline. I get the advantages of both. But since I work in a group, I should “blend in” and adopt our philosophy.</p>

<p>A lot of coding work is not just about speed typing like what is commonly shown online. It also involves a lot of reading, staring into space, and walking to think about how best to implement an idea. And then there’s debugging - another kind of beast. I know how to debug my own code but to formally test and understand other people’s code is something that I am not very experienced with. And since I’m a total newbie, I decided to ask google for advice and I found two nice articles:</p>

<p>1.) <a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-to-learn-an-existing-code-base-28b88d954bfd">How to learn and existing code base</a>
2.) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/89pjdy/how_to_learn_a_new_codebase_quickly/">How to learn a new codebase quickly</a></p>

<p>I’m going to try the things they adviced here. But so far, I’ve spent the past week going through the structure of the code base, looking at the files and which inputs go to which functions. I also listed a lot of questions because some of the functions used were built-in functions from third party softwares. So far, I think the questions helped me a lot because we were able to reproduce the problem and now have a solution to the first “baby” task. There are about 50 more issues to deal with haha. So it’s important to ask questions, but also make sure you’ve put in the effort to explore the problem. Here’s a good guide to asking technical questions from Tim Head - <a href="https://betatim.github.io/posts/getting-answers/">Getting Answers to Your Technical Questions</a>. Also a good way to think about the idea of “social credit” in the tech world.</p>

<h1 id="things-left-to-do">Things left to do</h1>
<p>So far I’ve dealt with most zeroth order tasks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>finding a room</li>
  <li>finding an orthopedic surgeon</li>
  <li>arrival formalities</li>
  <li>banking</li>
  <li>setting my work schedule (making progress daily - except break days)</li>
  <li>learning the codebase and making baseline configurations for my analyzer</li>
</ul>

<p>Some first-order tasks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>reproducing some bugs and figuring out a fix - discuss code-base (talk about asking technical questions)</li>
</ul>

<p>Next urgent things is to implement the solution to the bug at hand, making a first presentation, moving to my new place, learning french for my first doctor’s appointment. Let’s see what happens!</p>

<h1 id="something-i-wrote-on-an-emotional-day">Something I wrote on an emotional day</h1>

<p>On one of my more emotional days, I wrote a bunch of things that I decided to copy and paste here. I think I was talking to myself, thinking about different points in my life. I decided to not edit it and just put it here:</p>

<p>“at that point in your life you are not sure where you will live.
at that point in your life you can afford to choose where to live.
at that point in your life you can turn things around.
at that point in your life where you can make decisions for your future self and the future self of the people you want to “keep” connected with.
at that point in your life you have some agency to make choices.
at that point in your life where your decisions are not dictated of the urgency of the “now”. that you can pause, is a luxury. So don’t ever minimize who tried to survive and made it. and then remember that there are those who are still trying to make it through.
This is not the most evolved thinking. this is me also just trying to or still trying figure things out in life, and trying each time to make better choices and better actions.
“</p>

<p>And then, a few days later, the 2nd to the last episode of “The Good Place” came out and it made me think about the finiteness of our time on earth. I wrote some notes from the episode. These are again, unedited.</p>

<p>“if you got everything you wanted.
i am in paradise”
“we’re a little bit sad because we know we’re going to die. that knowledge is what gives life meaning”
vacations are only special because they end.
and then you go..”
“having enough time with the people you love”</p>

<p>I’m ok. I’m doing well. But I miss some people and I think about them frequently. But it was the right move to go here.</p>
