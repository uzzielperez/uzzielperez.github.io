    <p>I couldn’t afford formal lessons in French and don’t really have a friend who could speak french with me. Am also embarrassed to say that I’ve been learning Spanish through duolingo for more than a year now and yet if you put me face-to-face with a native speaker, I could barely converse. I could watch “El ministerio del tiempo” though and read a children’s book quite ok. But I won’t be able to survive in Spain or South America. Now, I really need to learn french for practical reasons. I also want to be able to meet people and to be able to converse in a non-superficial way. I wonder if I could “hyperlearn” the language. By hyperlearning the language, I’m trying to pick it up by exposing myself to it through at least a few hours of duolingo a day, and watching some videos in French. Same thing that I did with learning Spanish but only more hours in a single day for the next few weeks.</p>

<p>Duolingo is “gameified”. Sometimes, high rankings and progress levels are illusions. With it I was able to “read and listen” but not speak. I feel like one of those Filipino kids born and raised here in america who can’t speak Tagalog but can understand it if someone speaks to them. I conclude that reading and listening are more passive than speaking.</p>

<p>Duo did help me pick up and acquire the rules, the pronounciation without me going through boring theory first the way we learned English in classrooms growing up. I like how it gives you tips showing the rules through examples and you pick up the nuances of the language. They also massively improved the app by adding new features such as the “Duolingo stories and audio” and “Duolingo podcasts” but the last one is Spanish Only. But something’s missing. Am not sure how they can incorporate this part in the app though. Maybe it’s like in the super advanced levels which I don’t have time to get up to. So I’m going to try this hyperlearning approach by incorporating “thought construction” - the deliberate act of “thinking in another language”. One can do this in several ways. In my formal English and German classes we do this by doing skits or writing letters and essays. I initially wanted to imagine real-life scenarios and thinking of what I’m going to say, e.g. going to the bakery, or meeting a doctor. E.g. “Je voudrais un baguette”, “Vous avez une fracture”. But just writing down or learning sentences about mundane things feels so contrived. So I’m going to experiment with short stories in French. I’ll see how it goes. But right now, my Spanish is still “mucho mejor que mi frances”.</p>
