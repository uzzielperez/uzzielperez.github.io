    <p>The truth is, I don’t really drink and go to bars. Doctors say I can’t. But if I could, I’ve always gauged my understanding of a concept based on how well I can explain it to someone else. And if I could explain a difficult concept to an ordinary person in succint way without boring them, I think I can be happy.
So, the other day, I was quite disappointed when I was put on the spot to explain <em>spontaneous symmetry breaking</em> to a first year physics graduate student and nothing of sense flowed out of my mouth. While I eventually resorted to showing a really simple mathematical example, that afternoon left a bitter taste in my mouth!</p>

<p>I am attempting nothing new here. There are great discussions on symmetry breaking in the context of particle physics. I’m mainly writing about this for my own pleasure and satisfaction.</p>

<h2 id="progression">PROGRESSION</h2>
<p>I’ve decided to write my technical articles in several levels.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Level 0: Explaining things to my baby nephew.</li>
  <li>Level 1: Explaining things to my science-hating friends or a guy in a bar. Actually, if i can explain things to my (ex) wife who absolutely hates math, I consider myself successful!</li>
  <li>Level 2: Explaining things to my Lyft Driver from Chicago/Illinois. (There are quite a number of Illinois Lyft/Uber drivers I met who are fans of science. I think it’s because of Fermilab!)</li>
  <li>Level 3: Explaining things to my 20 year old self (out of college)!</li>
  <li>Level 4: Explaining things to my professors so that they’d give me a degree!</li>
</ul>

<p>Feel free to jump levels if you like!</p>

<h3 id="level-0-explaining-symmetry-to-a-five-year-old">Level 0: Explaining symmetry to a five year old.</h3>
<p>When my nephew was about two years old, one of the first shapes he learned was a circle. It’s been almost three years since I last saw him so whatever I wished I could teach him, I tried to show to other kids here. So a circle is a shape that is super symmetric. No matter which angle you turn it, it will always look the same no matter what. Similarly, if you had a black ball, you can rotate it in whichever way and it would look the same.</p>

<p>Now, I think the second shape I taught him was a square. That one is less symmetric than the first. If you could tell why then you should move on to the next level.</p>

<p>Unlike a circle, there are only a finite number of ways where you can rotate the square for it to look the same as how you first saw it. For example, the only way for it to look the same each time is if you only make a fourths of a full turn. What’s interesting is if I go on and add more sides to a regular polygon until it starts looking like a circle, the more symmetry it has!</p>

<p>The examples above are just simple examples on rotational symmetry. There’s another kind of symmetry that I love showing to kids. I’m pretty sure this is familiar to many of you - making paper hearts and butterflies! It’s a kind of mirror symmetry where the shape on one side is exactly the same on the other side of a line.</p>

<h3 id="level-1-explaining-things-to-my-ex-wife-or-a-stranger-who-doesnt-know-physics">Level 1: Explaining things to my (ex) wife, or a stranger who doesn’t know physics.</h3>

<p>Sometimes I tease my (ex) wife, “Wow, you look symmetric today!” It was once said that symmetry is closely associated with beauty. A lot of architectural gems have a sense of proportion and balance. A famous one is the Taj Mahal.</p>

<p>Symmetry is also a striking feature of living organisms. For example, we humans are bilaterally symmetric. If you draw a vertical line in the middle of our body we pretty much look the same on both sides, just like a butterfly. Interestingly, there are other creatures have another kind of symmetry, that’s similar to how we rotated the square and the circle. If we look at a starfish or a sea urchin or cut an apple, we could see a some symmetry when we rotate it around its center point. This is some kind of radial symmetry. Recall that the square has a four-fold symmetry, i.e. it’s symmetric with respect to rotations of 90 degrees around its center. Starfish look like they have a <em>pentaradial</em> symmetry, <em>penta</em> meaning a five-fold symmetry. Since my wife doesn’t like math, I have to explain that 360 degrees is a full rotation and that means a five-fold symmetry corresponds to a 72-degree rotational symmetry about their centre.</p>

<p>Now it may be arguable that perfect symmetry corresponds to what we find beautiful. Julia Roberts has a slight asymmetry in her smile and I think she’s still one of the most beautiful women in the world. We actually owe our existence to some kind of asymmetry that started way back in the lifetime of the universe. And this is something I usually enjoy talking to science aficionados who don’t necessarily have any formal training in it.</p>

<h3 id="level-2-to-my-favorite-lyft-driver-from-illinois">Level 2: To my favorite Lyft Driver from Illinois.</h3>

<p><em>A symmetry is a transformation that leaves the object unchanged.</em></p>

<p>My favorite Lyft Driver (I’ll call him David here) loved learning about Space and particle physics on a popular level. He said he was from New York, was a businessman in his youth. He used to be a music producer handling concerts and albums and all those cool stuff. I’m happy that he was one of those guys I could talk to about the beginning of the Universe from a scientific perspective. For both of us ther alternative is not worth discussing.</p>

<p>At that time I got to tell him a little about extra dimensions but if we had more time together I’d probably talk more about how the universe evolved and how some particles get to have mass.</p>

<p>Now, it’s interesting to point out that the mass that we have is not equal to the mass of its parts. For instance, if you look at an proton (1 GeV) is so much more than the mass of two up quarks (<script type="math/tex">\approx 3</script> MeV) and a down quark (<script type="math/tex">\approx 5</script> MeV). By the way, particle physicists talk about mass in units of energy. It’s because of mass-energy equivalence, <script type="math/tex">E = mc^2</script>, where we conveniently set c = 1! Now it turns out, that the rest of the mass comes from the binding energy that keeps these quarks together. But another question is, where do the masses of the quarks come from?</p>

<ul>
  <li>fermions and W and Z bosons get their mass from the higgs field</li>
  <li>Where did the higgs field come from?</li>
</ul>
