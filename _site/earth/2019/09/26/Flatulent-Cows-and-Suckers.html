  <p><strong>Forget beef, let’s eat humans to solve the climate crisis. Except the fit ones. They’re not very tasty.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="were-all-screwed-and-we-cant-do-anything-about-it-as-individuals-cant-we">We’re all screwed and we can’t do anything about it as individuals. Can’t we?</h2>

<p>There’s this idea circulating online that individual efforts of reducing one’s carbon footprint is too minor to matter. It doesn’t matter if you decide to live off the grid, eat bugs, give up beef, and ditch your car if the big emitters continue to emit. If you put it into perspective, an individual’s 100% reduction on their carbon footprint won’t even make up 1% of the global reduction. So, what’s the point? Is this accurate? Do individual actions not matter?</p>

<p>Objectively, I do think that these individual efforts do not do much. But, changing your consumption patterns, encouraging people within your network to rethink their ways can produce a domino effect. Campaign for politicians who would push for policies that would de-carbonize the economy. Personally, it remains a challenge for me to communicate with conservatives within my circle that climate change is real. I would probably not convince them to vote in a certain way. But I do think these people do care about environmental destruction. All the more reason to call it the “climate crisis” rather than climate change or global warming.</p>

<h2 id="changing-peoples-minds">Changing people’s minds</h2>

<p>I used to be very active on Facebook posting politically agitating materials. I was quite tough and didn’t mince words. But then I realized that I was not doing any good. One would think that if you keep at it, you’d probably plant seeds of doubt in their minds and make them skeptical of their own deep-seated beliefs. It turns out that’s not the case. These people are quite resistant to new information fed into them. In fact, they are resistant of any information that does not conform to their worldview. If you give them facts, they would be thought of as propaganda material or “fake news”. So I stopped my old ways and had to rethink my strategy. But whenever I saw these conservative acquaintances in person I tried to ask them questions. Sometimes, if a person arrives at a conclusion that contradicts their position by themselves, it can be powerful way to tip them over to the other side.</p>

<!-- One time, I was at a conservative Filipino friend's house. I mentioned to her that the other day the temperature at Alaska was 85 &deg;F. She was shocked. I was hoping she'd mention "climate change". She was a big Trump supporter. She said, "Golly! El Ni&ntilde;no is really here." I wasn't sure where that idea came from. We experienced El Ni&ntilde;no in the Philippines so that's probably where it came from. Despite being a science communicator for many years, I still find myself at a loss for words or strategy on how to deal with these people. -->

<h2 id="global-warming-where-you-at">“Global Warming, where you at?”</h2>

<p>The difficulty with climate change is that it’s an abstract concept for many. It’s not as visual as for example the effects of filling the ocean or river with trash. I found that conservatives do have strong feelings to the latter. For them to understand climate change may mean we have several sessions of teaching them several things. What’s the difference between climate and weather? How do greenhouse gases trap heat in our atmosphere? Does it mean that it will be warmer all the time? Are all extreme weather events due to climate change? Why are some places getting snow during spring? Why should we limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius?</p>

<p>On a cold day in April, I overheard a student ask “Global Warming, where you at?”. I wanted to run after him but couldn’t really think of a smart, witty comeback. Sounds a lot like the orange <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1090074254010404864">President’s tweet</a> back in January when the midwest was experiencing a deadly polar vortex. The problem is, I don’t think there ever will be a witty comeback for these simplistic thinkers. You can even try asking random science graduate students about why such brutal cold snaps occur and I bet they’ll not be able to explain this to anyone in a snap.</p>

<p>There are several major jet streams that circle the earth. These are very fast-flowing air currents that travel up to 200 miles per hour. The polar front jet is the relevant one we want to look at. This fast-stream of air is due to a strong temperature contrast between the cold air up north and the tropical warm air. The stronger this contrast the stronger jet stream. If you weaken this jet stream, it can break and dip down south. This is essentially what happened in the Midwest in January. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/01/30/science/polar-vortex-extreme-cold.html">nytimes</a> actually made cool visuals on how this breaking happens.</p>

<p>Everytime I encounter a climate change denier, I get outraged, for a few seconds at least. (I’m practicing the art of low-reactivity). The brain sometimes tend to warp and overestimate the bad stuff. I was thinking that majority of Americans don’t believe in climate change. Turns out that is not the case. More than half of Americans think that global warming is mostly human-caused. You can read more about it <a href="http://www.theclimatechat.org/americans-on-climate-change">here</a> and the <a href="http://www.theclimatechat.org/americans-on-climate-change">actual paper here</a>. Despite this, it still bugs me that it’s not a hundred percent. It bugs me even more that majority of those who actually don’t think climate change is real are people in power! The reason is, I don’t think we have enough time to reverse climate change. Our goal is essentially two-fold. First, we need to reduce emissions to pre-industrial levels. Second, we need to suck the excess greenhouse gases that are already there.</p>

<p>Greta Thunberg actually gives us a good a good set of numbers in her <a href="https://youtu.be/rhQVustYV24">interview</a> in the Daily Show. To stay within the 1.5 °C limit of global temperature rise, we must not emit more than 360 gigatons of carbon dioxide. That’s just a little more than 50\% chance to stay within the safe zone. We’re not even looking at the numbers for other greenhouse gases like methane! At the rate we are going we only have around 8 years left. That 8 years is not a constant. Our timer is actually ticking faster and faster because the biggest emitters are emitting more and more.</p>

<h2 id="dont-despair-there-are-solutions">Don’t despair. There are solutions.</h2>

<p>My friend said, “eat rich people and we solve the world’s problems overnight!”. I agree. Must be the best solution of them all.</p>

<p>There’s no one solution to this complex problem. People have proposed renewables ([^1]: in Alabama you can tell Alabama Power to source a part of your energy from renewables. You’d have to pay at least $5 more for that though. You can also sign up for <a href="https://www.arcadiapower.com">Arcadia Power</a> for a similar service.), better energy storage solutions, buying carbon offsets, carbon sequestration, carbon taxation, sustainable food production and encouraging more people to use mass transit ([^2]: I tend to look for the mass transit systems in each place I go before I use uber. I love train systems and rate cities based on their public transport system)! The list goes on. As an individual, we can choose to use our cars less, not eat beef and hamburgers. Reducing demand for beef would help us get rid of farting cows (*wink. <a href="https://youtu.be/JDcro7dPqpA?t=456">Thanks for the joke AOC!</a>).</p>

<p>We can also vote and campaign for politicians who clearly have a plan for the climate crisis. Here in my home department, I’ve also been trying to convince people here to give a course on <a href="https://vimeo.com/247344851">“Physics for future Presidents”</a>. I think there are just too many world leaders, key decision makers who know NOTHING about the science behind key issues like climate change.</p>

<h2 id="greta-thunberg-is-a-sucker-and-we-should-all-be">Greta Thunberg is a sucker! And we should all be!</h2>

<p>Have you ever heard of <a href="https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-is-the-tragedy-of-the-commons-nicholas-amendolare">“The Tragedy of the commons”</a>?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>It’s the phenomenon in which members of a social group face choices in which selfish, individualistic, or uncooperative decisions, though seemingly more rational by short-term benefits to separate players, produce long-term consequences for the group as a whole</strong> - <a href="https://www-jstor-org.libdata.lib.ua.edu/stable/30000542?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents">The Tragedy of the Commons</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We all have one planet and we all depend on it in order to live. In this game, there are the “free riders” and the “suckers”. In the last <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/9/24/20880416/un-climate-action-summit-2019-greta-thunberg-trump-china-india">UN Climate Action summit</a>, the most vulnerable countries to climate change committed more aggressive cut downs on their emissions but the biggest countries like China, India and the US didn’t. These big countries would not sacrifice the short-term benefit of economic growth even though in the long run, we’re all going to be doomed. It’s clear who “suckers” are in here. They’re losing both in the short-term in the long-term.</p>

<p>Greta Thunberg is sort of a sucker in a game theoretical sense. It would have been easier for her to fly to New York instead of sailing across the Atlantic. There are only a few people in this planet who’d do the same. The only way she could win this “game” is if we all risk being suckers! Is there a strategy for us to make multiple players cooperate in a game where “defection” promises a better payoff? I’m going to try to explore that next after I review for my exam.</p>

Cal Newport is a computer scientist from Dartmouth College. He got his PhD from MIT, he's an accomplished researcher with several seminal papers under his name, several books and a successful blog that has been up for over a decade. I've been following his work since college and I would say I wouldn't have graduated with a Physics degree without his advice on practicing "deliberate practice" and "deliberate creativity". One of the simplest and most practical pieces of advice that he gave was to [tally "Deep Work Hours" and milestones](http://www.calnewport.com/blog/2016/12/07/from-deep-tallies-to-deep-schedules-a-recent-change-to-my-deep-work-habits/). -->
