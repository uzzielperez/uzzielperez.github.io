  <p><strong>Three quarks for Muster Mark .</strong> - Finnegan’s Wake, by James Joyce</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Protons aren’t elementary particles. They’re made of some smaller objects called ‘quarks’. Kind of a funny and strange name. It was Murray Gell-Mann’s idea in 1963 to call them as such. He took the name from James Joyce’s Finnegans Wake: “Three quarks for Muster Mark!”. Even funnier now are the names of the 6 different kinds of quarks. There’s the up (u), down (d), strange (s), charm (c), top (t), bottom (b) or beauty quark. I don’t know who came up with these funny names! These quarks have color, not the kind of color that we see. To my understanding it’s some kind of bookkeeping device that’s similar to a charge. When these colored quarks are combined they form hadrons.
When quarks hadronize, they form these colorless particles called baryons and mesons. Protons (uud) and neutrons (udd) are baryons since they’re formed with an odd number of quarks. Then there are the mesons like pions, J/psi (<script type="math/tex">c\bar{c}</script>) and the Upsilon (<script type="math/tex">b\bar{b}</script>). They’re formed with a quark-antiquark pair. These individual quarks are glued together by the “strong force” whose mediator particle is called the gluon. And these gus</p>

<p>Because protons aren’t just spherical point particles, we get different outcomes when colliding them. Sometimes, we’ll get quarks annihilating with antiquarks and get two photons for instance. Sometimes, gluon fusion can occur and we’d something else or two photons as well. It’s amazing that the probability of a certain outcome happening can be predicted quite well. There is some room for improvement though.</p>

<p>We can approximate the probability of a process happening by counting the vertices and taking note of the nature of the coupling of the particles.
For example, the diagrams below have a probability of occuring of the order <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{O}(\alpha^n_s)</script> where n is the number of vertices where the strong interaction occurs. If we replace the gluons with photons, we’d just have to replace <script type="math/tex">\alpha_s</script> with the electromagnetic coupling constant <script type="math/tex">\alpha_E = 1/137</script>. So from left to right in the image below, the probability goes as <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)</script>, <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{O}(\alpha^2_s)</script> and <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{O}(\alpha^4_s)</script>. Now, what exactly is the value of the strong coupling constant. That depends.</p>

<p><img alt="Lumi" src="/assets/img/qcd_feynman_diagrams.jpg" /></p>

<p>The behaviour of the strength of the strong force is unlike that of gravity and electromagnetic force where the strength goes inversely as the square of the distance. For the strong force, the strength increases with distance. At short distances, the quarks/gluons are quasi-free. This phenomenon is called ‘Asymptotic freedom’.</p>

<p><img alt="Lumi" src="/assets/img/Lambda_QCD.jpg" /></p>

<p>The strong coupling constant varies with distance and energy. At higher energies, <script type="math/tex">\alpha_s</script> it goes the opposite way because of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle <script type="math/tex">\Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{h}{4\pi}</script>. When <script type="math/tex">\alpha_s = 1</script>, we have the demarcation line between what is called “non-perturbative” and “perturbative” Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). The reason why it becomes non-perturbative is because higher-order corrections goes bigger and bigger. When <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
\alpha_s < 1 %]]></script>, we are able to use perturbative techniques to make predictions and so far they’ve been doing pretty well.</p>
