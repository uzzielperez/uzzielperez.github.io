    <h2 id="how-do-you-catch-a-ghost">How do you catch a ghost?</h2>

<p>How do you actually catch neutrinos? In CMS, the detector really can’t detect their signals so they’re only interpreted as “missing energy”.
Since they can hardly be stopped by anything along its path, they can be “messenger particles” that send “unadulterated messages” from farflung parts of the universe.</p>

<p>The highest energy neutrinos (<script type="math/tex">10^6</script> MeV) are produced in super high-energy collisions that cannot be done in the LHC. These collisions could happen deep in outer space nuclei where a start collapses for example. These produce cosmic rays with pions and muons which subsequently decay into neutrinos. These neutrinos don’t really get bent by magnetic fields nor do they interact with material outerspace. So how do we detect them?</p>

<p>Down in Antartica, a cubic kilometer of super clear ice has been setup. These have also been drilled with holes to put some detectors that capture any trace of neutrinos. But how? If the neutrino energy is high enough and if this hits an ice molecule it then smashes it into pieces. These pieces travel faster through the ice than light does. These then leave behind a cone of blue light called Cerenkov radiation just like how supersonic jets leaves a sonic boom cone when it travels faster than the speed of sound in air. The signals are picked up by the detectors with photomultiplier tubes. Just like in CMS, the information is then stored and analyzed by scientists. This cool experiment is called IceCube.</p>

<p>There are other cool experiments that operate with the same principle. There’s one in Japan called Super Kamiokande. But I won’t talk about them here anymore.</p>

<h2 id="neutrino-beams">Neutrino beams</h2>

<p>It’s kind of interesting that neutrino beams can even be made by man.
They hardly interact with anything so they’re hard to control. We first need highly energetic protons that are accelerated and smashed onto a target. When a proton gets smashed, its constituents, gluons, quarks then hadronize and form other particles like pions. Pions could be positively charged, negatively charged or neutral. Neutral pions could decay into a pair of photons. Charged pions are more unstable and decay into a muon plus a neutrino.</p>

<p>So if neutrinos are uncontrollable, how do you make them go in a relatively thin beam? Well you can’t control them. But you can control their charged parents, the pions. Powerful magnetic fields could be used to redirect the pions to travel roughly in the same direction. And then when they decay into neutrinos, they’d just travel along in the same direction. But this isn’t yet a pure neutrino beam! What do we do with the muons? We need to put some material that would absorb them. Neutrinos would just go through these block absorbers like GHOSTS!</p>

<p>These neutrino beams are used for different particle physics experiments that answer questions on neutrino oscillations, neutrino mass hierarchy and new neutrino types.</p>

<h2 id="the-neutrinoless-double-beta-decay">The Neutrinoless double beta decay</h2>

<p>I’ll talk about the Neutrinoless double beta decay <script type="math/tex">0\nu \beta\beta</script> relatively quickly. I don’t know much about it to be honest but I’m trying to learn it. If the neutrino is a Majorana particle or it is the antineutrino of itself, and there is at least a type of neutrino which are not massless, then <script type="math/tex">0\nu \beta\beta</script> could occur.</p>

<p>Experiments that search for this phenomenon use a bunch of decaying isotopes with low background. They look for electrons that come out of neutrons decaying into two protons. I’m not into this, but a friend of mine is and he’s been one of the first few people who’ve been using convolutional neural network on this type of search. Pretty cool!</p>

<h2 id="particle-nature-of-dark-matter">Particle Nature of Dark Matter</h2>

<p>So we know by now that the Standard Model only explains 4% of the universe. Right now, we’re trying to figure out the 21% which is made of some mysterious thing called dark matter. It could be made of entirely something else. But their are constraints as to which kind of particles they could be.</p>

<p>First, we know that these guys do not interact strongly with ordinary matter and hence they should be “non-baryonic”. It’s not made up of  quarks and gluons that are confined in a baryon.</p>

<p>Second, it should be “non-visible”. Duh! Well, we can’t see it! But we can see its effects on visible matter though. If we can’t see it then it does not interact electromagnetically. Third, it is stable over cosmological time scales, otherwise it wouldn’t be keeping galaxies together today. They are also “cold”, i.e. non-relativistic and should explain the Dark matter relic abundance.</p>

<h2 id="last-of-the-series">Last of the Series</h2>

<p>I think this would be the last article on particle physics review series. I would still write some more particle physics in the future but not as intensely. I hope to be writing some more interesting stuff on other things I like and hopefully get started on more programming projects!</p>

<p>Was fun!</p>
