    <h2 id="gut-reaction-to-failing">Gut Reaction to failing</h2>
<p>I went with a good friend of mine to North Carolina for Snow Tubing. On our way up the mountains, his car started to skid and his engine sounded strange. I said in a soft voice, “what’s going on?”. He didn’t respond. He was cool and collected. No “Oh shit! We’re fucked!” even if the front hood started to smoke. There was no cellphone signal too! So, even if it was probably a crisis, I didn’t get too worried because he was cool. Within 5 minutes, strangers helped us.</p>

<p>I talked to him later on. I told him that I was amazed with how he dealt with everything. I wondered if he was always like that. He told me that his problem-solving mode was on overdrive. I was at awe. He apologized to me for putting me in that situation but I said, I was the one having the free ride. I couldn’t help him get his car back. He admitted to me that he broke down in private and that he was thinking that he’s too relaxed about things. That he made a mistake in buying a car - a luxury he didn’t need.</p>

<p>When things go wrong at one point, I was wondering if it is right to call that moment we made a decision a mistake. Was marrying someone a mistake? Was deciding to be friends with someone you like a mistake? Was getting into a university you had doubts with a mistake? My answer is no to all of them. If I went back in time, there are things I might have done slightly differently. I look back and am thankful that I made those choices.</p>

<p>When things are going right, you tap your shoulders and tell yourself, “ah good decision!”. And when things go horribly wrong, why is our gut reaction in the form of deep regret and calling ourselves stupid?</p>

<p>I was trying to put myself in my friend’s shoes. I tried to imagine that moment I decided to say yes to buying that car. Without rigorously listing the pros and cons, I might have thought, I want to get this car for the following reasons: 1.) I need it so I can easily get food/groceries. 2.) I want to meet and see people outside of Tuscaloosa 3.) I want to go on nature trips like I used to back home 4.) I want to be able to go to the airport, go to doctor’s out-of-the-county doctor’s appointments without bugging people to take me. I personally have many reasons to get that car. It was cheap and in a good condition. But I guess, all throughout my stay here the statement “a car is a money sink” unreasonably held more weight in my head than all those pro reasons combined. And in a sense, I had the opposite problem, “I wanted a car, but I never had the courage to get one. And here’s my friend having the time of his life being mobile and all.”</p>

<p>Our gut reaction to failing is in the form of being demoralized and having a feeling of helplessness. There’s this helpful article by a psychologist named Guy Winch that I’ve been trying to put in practice. One of the ways we can practice emotional first aid is to redirect our gut reaction when we fail. We can make a list of factors we can control if we were to try again. For example, when preparing or planning, how could we improve on those aspects. We can reduce our feeling of helplessnes and make things better in the future.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Never regret anything because at one time it was exactly what you wanted.</strong> – Some meme I saw somewhere</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do we make better decisions? How much should we listen to the “something’s off” voice? How does time, the lack of resources, specially poverty affect decision-making? I’ve been reading and thinking about these questions the past few days since the trip. I decided to split this blog post because I need to wake up early for work tomorrow and damn I think I’m really behind on my physics work now. :P #soliloquy</p>
