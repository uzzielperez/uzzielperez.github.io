    <p>I broke my leg a few days ago. It was one of the more difficult overhanging climbing routes. The last time I finished it I was with my more experienced friends. Been climibng 2-3 times a week with or without friends, I decided I was confident enough to try it out on my own. Been accustomed to falling from a height and trying again but this one turned out to be too high and I didn’t have time to roll ever and increase surface area to reduce impact and pressure. Hence the broken leg.</p>

<p>One of the things I appreciated was, a bunch of the frontliners went to bring me things to reduce my pain. They circled around me and we told each other stories to distract me from the pain as I waited for some help. It turns out we eventually needed an ambulance. I felt the need to say sorry for interrupting their climbing and they should just carry on with what they were doing. But they stayed on like they preferred to stay with me (if they didn’t they didn’t make me feel it). It was one of those many moments when I thought to myself “what is their incentive or motivation for helping me?”. I could think of two things. But I will leave things to your imagination.</p>

<p>Either way, I am supremely appreciative of the care and attention I got. And I did not expect it. On my way out on a stretcher, Cooper, one of the frontliners, played my one of my favorite upbeat Whitney Houston songs. He asked me previously what I listen to lately. I gave a thumbs up to everyone. I was in pain. I felt like crying not out of physical pain but from the “love” from these humans I only knew from borrowing wall climbing gear from.</p>

<h2 id="when-acquaintances-evolve-to-family">When acquaintances evolve to family</h2>
<p>I came to Alabama not knowing anyone except my adviser. But over the years, specially this Fall semester, I got to know people more deeply. I was able to go out there and show myself, not just to one person, but a handful of people. I already knew them from before. But the level of trust and friendship, I didn’t imagine to evolve to this level.</p>

<p>From getting to Alabama, to moving and settling here, my Tuscaloosa allomum, Ate Jett and my adviser prove to be constants to this day. When “Could you help me go to the hospital?” and “Could I miss the meeting tomorrow?” were the only questions you asked and you get more consideration than you expected, my heart just got soft. And my bestest of friends here came even if I’m super drugged and sleepy. And then there were people who I barely knew but visited me twice and would do for me what nurses did. What is going on? Is it just because I tried not to expect too much and got so much more? They offer to drive you around, say sorry for what had happened, and ehem, recently help give you a bath. I can’t help but think “why the hell are these people so kind?”. It feels as if my faith in humanity was restored. I’m going to miss them all as I am bound to leave in a month. And I would start new friendships.</p>

<p>I noticed that at each stage of my life, from grade school, high school, college, my first job, my short time at CERN, grad school, I would have at least one best friend whom I would completely open up to and would completely open up to me. And they’re part of my deep network that just evolves. Usually, there’s some event that instigates the unmasking, having a broken heart, being disappointed in some outcome, having an accident or an episode, but they’re there or we show we are their for each other not because we get anything in return but because of a real feeling of love. And often, it feels more organic when we both don’t expect that one of us we’ll still be there but are still there anyhow. I think that’s when we realize, ah, this person is in my “deep network”. We don’t have to talk every day but when we do, it just feels warm and fuzzy. (Or am I just still drugged right now with opioids? LOL!)</p>

<p>Did we just evolve to take care of each other in a tribe? When one is severely handicapped, do we have an instinct to go out of our way to help people? Do we have an instinct to pick up an object that someone dropped? Do babies have a concept of helping another person?</p>

<h2 id="baby-lab---are-babies-born-good">Baby Lab - Are Babies born good?</h2>

<p>I watched this video way back in 2013. Apparently, this is not the only time I tried to ask the question, “Are humans inherently good”?</p>

<p>The Yale Baby Lab helped give insights on how “little blobs” react to kindness through puppet shows. Given a choice between the two puppets, babies would often choose the “kind” puppet. I think the working definition of the “good guy” in one variant of the experiment, is the puppet that helps one achieve a goal. There’s another variant of the experiment which tests if babies have a sense of justice, i.e. have a high preference for those who “punish” a bad puppet. You can watch a good chunk of the experiment in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRvVFW85IcU">link</a>.</p>

<p>It’s interesting to know, that there is an intrinsic sense of morality in us that are hardwired in us that no bible or ethics class have to teach. Props to the authors of this paper <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06288">“Social evaluation by preverbal infants”</a> for designing this mindblowing study!</p>

<h2 id="what-do-i-owe-to-them">What do I owe to them?</h2>
<p>The truth is the only reason that I am alive and gotten this far from what my life used to be back home was because people helped me and my family. There are people who didn’t give up on me on my lowest points. And when I ask if I could pay them back, in kind or in a monetary kind of way, I hear the “Pay it forward” more than once. I don’t want anyone else’s bones to get broken and then I’ll come and help them with getting a bath. But if I do find someone in need of something, I will try to help. That desire to help, because of a previous experience of kindness, is how I think “kindness” survives and evolves. It’s because we’ve seen it from others and we let it live on.</p>

<p>Also, I owe it to a lot of people to start being a little more mobile on my own and religiously doing those leg lifts and toe wiggling to prevent total muscle atrophy. Let the toe wiggling commence!</p>
