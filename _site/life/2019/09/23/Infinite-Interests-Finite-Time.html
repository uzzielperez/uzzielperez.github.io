    <p>Two years ago, at a social mixer at a summer school in Princeton, I got one of most powerful advice I’ve ever heard. It was at a place a couple of blocks from Einstein’s house so that must have had an extra effect. I was bundled together with fellow asians when <a href="https://vimeo.com/287311986">Peter Elmer</a>, came over to just chat. At some point we were talking about career paths, what’s hot and what’s not. In the end, he said these trends are all going to pass so the most important thing to do is follow what you are truly interested in. It sounds like a typical, simplistic advice but if you come to think about it, following your curiosity makes all the difference in the world.</p>

<p>I am kind of lucky that what I consider interesting right now could lead to a lucrative career in data science in big tech companies. I just need to do a few more projects using industry-standard tools and put them on GitHub. Plus prepare for technical interviews. Still takes a bunch of work but it’s not super impossible. I think I’m leaning towards the “industry” path. But I always have this lingering question in my head, am I doing something important? Am I doing something of value to other people? Unfortunately, right now, my answer is almost always no. Will I be able to eventually do important things? I hope so.</p>

<p>I am currently working on a particle physics project that looks for strange and very small deviations from the “Standard Model” of Particle Physics. It’s something like, looking for a soccer ball weirdly deviating from the path predicted by Newton’s laws. There must be some small “correction” to the model that needs to be understood. It’s not “useful” knowledge per se but I just need to remind myself of the slogan “The usefuleness of useless knowledge”. Probably some kind of false equivalence but Einstein’s General Relativity was once deemed useless for a while but it’s now an extremely important thing for GPS navigation!</p>

<p>I wish I am directly working on understanding diseases or illnesses, e.g. genetic, autoimmune diseases that are complex and are probably not traceable to a single gene. I wish that like a few of my friends that I was actively involved in lobbying for climate change policies or researching about carbon sequestration. I wish I could build C02/methane-sucking machines. I don’t know yet how I could penetrate the latter industry with my skillset but I am eager to find out. And then there’s my interest in understanding how deep-seated beliefs can be changed and how tipping points are reached. I told my adviser about this last year. He even told me that this work is probably one of the more important research questions that people should ask. I think particles are easier to understand than humans though!</p>

<p>I had also planned to do a few small projects on the side since 2016. I told myself I’d build an e-bike, a small aquaponics system with fishies and vegetables I could harvest, and an arduino/raspberry pi security system. I’ve not done any one of them but I did manage to grow a mealworm colony for my own consumption! Sustainable food production is quite interesting to me. It’s hard to start these projects because you need to spend for them, you need time to learn how to make them, and then you need time and energy to actually make them.</p>

<p>This blog is a project in itself. I got inspired by my friend’s mum, Barbara. She lives in Wisconsin and she does cool projects which she documents. Her blog got me writing again. There are a bunch of hard and social science topics that I’d like to have a working knowledge of. The best way to learn something is to be able to explain it to someone else. Then there’s learning Spanish and French. I’m quite disappointed that I’m still not conversational in another foreign language. I’ve been jumping around languages that they’re getting mixed up.</p>

<p>In principle, I am following my interests but I have too many of them. I do not have infinite time nor infinite energy and intelligence to be able to do do all of them. I can probably only do two research projects at a time. And the time-splitting is even asymmetric because one deserves more concentration than the other. It’s also a bad feeling to start many projects at a time and not take them to the finish line. I found Cal Newport’s <a href="http://www.calnewport.com/blog/2011/06/23/lab-notes-my-closed-loop-research-system/">closed-loop research system</a> quite helpful.</p>

<h2 id="dissertation-proposal-and-my-not-to-do-list">Dissertation Proposal and my not-to-do list</h2>

<p>Last week I presented my work to an external group composed of fellow researchers from Brown U. and Carnegie Mellon University. These were a bunch super smart people that I really looked up to so I was quite delighted when I got some excitement for the project I was working on. These guys are applying a novel analysis technique that my good friend from college proposed. I wanted to use the same technique for my research. Since it is a new idea, good results are not guaranteed. I have my candidacy exam coming up so my adviser told me to be careful. I got slightly sad that I couldn’t work on it right away. I knew I had to produce results within 2-3 weeks and prove that my proposed dissertation topic is feasible.</p>

<p>Now that I know that something exciting is next in line, I’m actually extra motivated to finish this proposal! The methods I’m using now are classical and time-tested methods. Not super fancy but unquestionably reliable. It’s less risky and it allows me to focus on the physics. When I finish, I’d write everything up and defend the proposal in a little over a month.</p>

<p>Just thinking about the finiteness of my resources reminds me that knowing what not to do is as important as knowing what to do. I am interested in a lot of things, exploring new possibilities but at the same time I dislike not being able to “accomplish” things.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtaxU6DZvLs">interview that I really liked, Elon Musk</a> said that humans have a natural tendency for wishful thinking. It’s important to make a rigorous assessment of what work you think is of high value. Value is relative, I believe. When you figure that out you have to work twice as hard as others and be tenacious. I guess that’s why he’s so accomplished and are working on high-impact, interesting projects like electric cars and space exploration! Steve Jobs was quite the same.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>For the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: ‘If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?’ And whenever the answer has been ‘No’ for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.</strong> – Steve Jobs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m a bit chiller and less intense than both Musk and Jobs. Love them or hate them, I like what they said. Taking things to the finish line is an incredible feeling and so is exploring things you’ve never seen before. And on a practical note, accomplishment, things you put in your portfolio gives you career leverage for a more autonomous and creative life.</p>
