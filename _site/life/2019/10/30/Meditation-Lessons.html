    <h2 id="i-cant-always-understand-the-world-through-equations">I can’t always understand the world through equations</h2>

<p>I’ve finally decided to sign-up for the premium version of the Headspace app. I’m really trying to be more patient, truly compassionate, less reactive and less anxious. Ever since my separation (going through divorce), I’ve been really committed to trying to understand myself and my relation with others.</p>

<p>As a physicist, I have an understanding of natural phenomena in terms of equations relating different variables. But not everything in the physical world can be accurately described by an equation. For example think of a double pendulum. The best thing you can do is to do some computer model instead of writing something close-formed. How much more do we need if we’re trying to understand something complex such as our own mind and how we deal with others? I’m not talking about massive social network where groups or individuals are considered as connected nodes. There’s a great deal of progress there in terms predicting social behaviour and decision making.</p>

<p>I think it would be less illuminating if I tried to write an equation or a program to model myself and my relationships. That would oversimplify many things and therefore would not have any predictive power. Hence for this, I think a qualitative description of the self would be more beneficial. If there’s a Jane Goodall for humans like me, I’d be happy to be one of her chimpanzees! I’d also be delighted to be part of experiments that does brain scans though! I want to know which parts of my brain gets activated when I feel certain things.</p>

<h2 id="ancient-wisdom">Ancient Wisdom</h2>
<p>“Lahat lahat. Sabay sabay.” I think my last philosophy prof said this. It means we take a look at “everything” (lahat lahat), at the “same time” (sabay sabay). It’s absolutely not how I approach my work, where I change one thing and see how it influences a result. Or if it’s a multivariable cause and effect, do pairs or combinations of changes and see their effects. When learning about the self, I need to relax and take it all in. Not controlling any feelings. Just being aware of them. Here meditation helps.</p>

<p>I’ve gotten back to taking meditation seriously and learning from ancient eastern wisdom. I had a phase in my life when I believed all these were just “woowoo” stuff until my allomum told me to try it for myself. It helped her a lot. Comparing my previous self sans meditation to now, I like me better now. Not perfect, but there’s less tension and anxiety. (I am not claiming anything for others here.)</p>

<p>I have been practicing some level of healthy skepticism whenever I think I’ve learned something new from some random input I got. So I’ve decided to read more about the effects of meditation from “reliable” sources. Here are some my allomum wrote [1,2]. She referred to a November 2014 Scientific American article by trained biologists. It’s called the “Mind of the Meditator.” The actual article [3] seems not to be open access but I found another link which anyone could read [4]. Your welcome. (Can I just say? This is so freaking amazing!)</p>

<h2 id="going-for-it">Going for it!</h2>
<p>So back to some philosophy. One of my zen masters is actually a renowned Filipina astrophysicist/data scientist. I am surprised she became a good friend of mine and I got really good pieces of advice from her. She taught me a Jedi/Zen trick of not worrying too much about things that are not in our control. Simplistic advice? It’s easier said than done. But practice makes us better at it. I’m a great worrier. This weird brain of mine looks at all possible outcomes and sometimes it hyperfocuses on the negative ones. I think we’re wired that way to prevent ourselves from getting hurt. But in this present world, I think the brain should learn to defocus from the negative outcomes. I don’t try to totally ignore them though.</p>

<p>During my qualifying exams, I cried and worried about not passing. I was afraid. I had no safety net. Going home was not an option economically. But my adviser told me that I was underestimating my ability. When he told me that he would “fight for me”, that sort of also helped me think more positively. The qualifiers became a challenge that wasn’t insurmountable. I think I started to just focus on solving tons of problems whenever I can. I studied 4 hours a day during the break. I watched “Desperate Housewives” with my ex in between for relaxation. Haha. I think I felt most peaceful after that. Because I stopped thinking about whether I’d go home or not and just put all my mental energy into learning every bit I can about electricity and magnetism.</p>

<p>I plan to write about the idea of “Survivorship bias” later on. In a nutshell, it’s a tendency for people to overlook everyone else who didn’t pass or survive a challenge because those who succeeded are sort of highlighted more. Because of this, people can sometimes grossly overestimate their chances of succeeding at something. It only leads to more damage for trying and trying. But the irony is, it’s precisely that refusal to accept limitation that pushes people to give things a shot, right?</p>

<p>Steve Jobs was good at pushing people to meet unreasonable deadlines. He has what people called a “reality distortion field”. Richard Feynman talked about the use of drums in warfare to convince soldiers that “they can do it!”. He said it’s something like “fooling yourself” that you are better than you are. And it gives you courage to do things that seem insurmountable. I kind of say the same things to myself when there is some difficult topic that I need to learn. I’ve also had some people who’ve panicked and broke down in front of me because of physics. And I try to tell them, they’re actually doing better than what they think they’re doing. The brain is weird. It helps to be with people who could give us a nice outsider’s perspective.</p>

<h2 id="when-to-give-up">When to give up</h2>

<p>When should you give up? I honestly don’t know the answer to the question. It’s not that I haven’t given up on something or someone even if I think I am persistent. I just don’t know when is the proper time or if what the proper reason is for giving up.</p>

<p>I’ve learned somewhere that you shouldn’t want anything too much and that desire is the root of all suffering. But it turns out that that there is a misconception about that idea from ancient Buddhist philosophy. Kate Bornstein put it simply. It’s the “clinging, the clutching” that is causing the suffering. An old article [5] expounds on this nicely.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>“A starting point for understanding desire is to differentiate between unhealthy and healthy desire. Unhealthy desire undermines psychological health, producing what Buddhism often calls “suffering” for short. Healthy desire can contribute to psychological well-being, happiness, and peace. If we place healthy and unhealthy desire on a spectrum, at one end we have the motivations that lead to some of the worst and most horrific things people do. But at the other end, desire expresses some of the most beautiful and noble aspects of human life.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>One way to distinguish the two ends of this spectrum is to differentiate between craving and aspiration. When the Buddha pointed to the cause of suffering, he used the word tanhà or thirst. It represents desire which is in some way compulsive, driven, and therefore not easy to let go of. This kind of desire is often accompanied by clinging, contraction, tension, or pressure.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s a powerful thing to know this. It helped me let go of things and not force things. I still try to do my best within what’s possible, but I think I’ve gradually learned to be more thoughtful of my actions when I’m trying to go for things I aspire for. It feels liberating.</p>

<p>I wish I learned these things in my youth. But I guess you only learn these things with some level of damage. :P</p>
