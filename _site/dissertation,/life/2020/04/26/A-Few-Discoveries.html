    <h3 id="markdown-slides-with-pandoc">Markdown Slides with pandoc</h3>
<p>I’ve found something really cool. Cool for me. Am not sure if it would be relatable for some. I’ve just learned this cool way of making “Beamer” presentations without using LATEX!</p>

<p>LATEX is cool but it is cumbersome. I also hate using keynote and powerpoint. But I found Markdown to be an easy way to lay out my thoughts. It’s a lot more free flowing. It’s just like taking notes. Better than word because it’s super easy to type equations and code too!</p>

<p>Initially, I was going to migrate all my presentations to Jupyter slides but I haven’t figured out a way to share them without making a public github repo and using <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/binder-examples/jupyter-rise/master?filepath=index.ipynb">Binder</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, let’s get back to the topic! Making Beamer Slides with Markdown and pandoc.</p>

<h4 id="setup">Setup</h4>
<p>For starters, I do recommend installing <a href="https://sandbox.anaconda.com/">anaconda</a> or just installing <a href="https://pandoc.org/installing.html">pandoc</a></p>

<h4 id="the-markdown-file">The Markdown File</h4>
<p>The slides are separated by single hashes and those also serve as the title. I’ve linked in the tutorials I’ve watched.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># Slide 1

# Slide 2

- Item
- Another Item
- Etc

# Slide 3

$$ \sum_{a,b} + x \infty $$

# Slide 4

- *This text is in italics*
- **This text is in bold**
- ~~This text has a line through it~~

# Slide 5

![Da Vinci Style CMS Detector](oreach-2009-001.jpg)

# Slide 6

Just want to credit LucidProgramming for the introductory [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-HqKSBZOXo).

# Prettification

Thanks to this [prettifying tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dum7q6UXiCE) from Luke Smith, we can add some metadata to make our presentation pretty.

You can find some themes and color themes [here](http://deic.uab.es/~iblanes/beamer_gallery/).

</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="styling">Styling</h4>

<p>You can add some metadata at the top and a separate .tex file to indicate some styles.</p>

<p><em>Metadata</em></p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>---
title:
- Uzzie Presentation
author:
- Uzziel Perez
hyperrefoptions:
- linktoc=all
- pdfwindowui
- pdfpagemode=FullScreen
pagenumbering:
- footer
---
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>styl.tex file</em></p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
\setbeamertemplate{navigation symbols}{}
\setbeamertemplate{footline}[frame number]

</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="getting-the-output">Getting the output</h4>
<p>To get the output, one can type this in the terminal:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
pandoc <span class="nt">-t</span> beamer presentation_sample.md <span class="nt">-o</span> output.pdf

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>If you have .tex file to set some stuff:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
pandoc <span class="nt">-t</span> beamer <span class="nt">--include-in-header</span><span class="o">=</span>header_pagenrs.tex presentation_sample.md <span class="nt">-o</span> output.pdf

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And the basic output looks like <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c7dTfYyWI109Z0bI0Z8zrbyHUSCgvcet/view?usp=sharing">this</a>.</p>

<h3 id="breaks-work-and-the-forest-nearby">Breaks, work and the Forest nearby</h3>

<p>There’s a nice forest-y part nearby and I’ve spent the last two daily walks outside, not using my knee scooter! I’m still a bit slow on the stairs but slowly I’m getting back to my normal walking. ^_^</p>

<p>The past week I was sort of drowning in work (not that anyone put me to it). I just wanted to solve a problem and get a critical amount of work done for me to advance to the next stage of my project. I think I’ve done it. I am tired. I think I will have to rethink the way I’ve done things. But one thing I’ve reconfirmed is that there is great value in focused work where I think about nothing else but the problem at hand. I basically dropped everything else until I finished it. I felt massive relief finishing it, solving problems, and building the code. But sort of felt exhausted in the end. I don’t know if this is a necessary kind of thing in the process specially when you are dealing with the nitty-gritty parts of the tailend of your work.</p>

<p>What I plan to do next is to spend the next few days working on detector software with a great degree of focus. The task is clear but the way to get to the finish line is not. So I’d have to do a lot of “exploring” and “playing around” to have a game plan. This project does not have “schedulable tasks”. Then when I figure it out I’ll code it and test it! Let’s see! For schedulable tasks, I’d need to prepare a presentation, do some simulations and also look at some detector images.</p>

<p>I think part of why I got so tired this week (until Thurs) was I spent every waking hour thinking about nothing but the analyzer code. There were two days that I didn’t even talk to my room mate. I didn’t get to exercise nor walk outside. And I felt robotic. My room mate looked sad too. So I got a little afraid she was thinking that I didn’t want to interact with her. Turns out she had a bad toothache. Ha! I gave her paracetamol. Didn’t work though.</p>

<p>Also probably didn’t help that I ate 5 boxes of Ferrero Rocher this week.. EEEK.</p>

<p><em>This morning, April 26, 2020</em>
Also realized that if I commit changes to this to the gh-pages repo it will tell me why the website blog won’t build. Just pushing to master doesn’t do but that still updates the site. So I fell asleep without the site updating.</p>
